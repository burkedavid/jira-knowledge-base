- **Cascade Effects:** Defects that trigger downstream issues
- **Quality Momentum:** Improving vs declining quality trajectories

   â€¢ Priority Action: [specific action needed]

Continue for the top 5-8 most critical components only.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES - STRICTLY ENFORCE:**
- Use ONLY plain text with **bold** for emphasis
- ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Tables of any kind - use numbered lists instead
- ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Any form of text highlighting or coloring
- Use simple bullet points (â€¢) and numbered lists only
- NO TABLES ANYWHERE - Always use structured lists for data presentation
