####  Manage issue type hierarchy levels

When you imported the issue type hierarchy, the top row of the spreadsheet
defined the names of the levels in the hierarchy (for example, Level1, Level2,
and so on). You can change these to something suitable for your application.

  1. Click on the Manage Issue Type Level tab to view the hierarchy levels. The Level Index indicates order of the levels in the hierarchy, with 1 being the most general, 2 being the next level down, and so on. 
  2. To rename a level, click on its Edit button. 
  3. Type a new Level Name, then press Apply.
