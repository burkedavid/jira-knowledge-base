###  Distribution

Distribution allows you to distribute documents associated with certain
document categories to users or groups of users. The recipients and
distribution actions are determined according to the category field values set
out in a distribution matrix (see [ Distribution matrix
](../User_Settings/Distribution_matrix.htm#h) ).

There are two types of distribution:Ã‚

  * [ Manual Distribution ](Manual_distribution.htm) \- allows you to manually distribute documents selected from the workspace folder structure 
  * [ Automatic ](Automatic_fi.htm) \- distributes documents according to their metadata
