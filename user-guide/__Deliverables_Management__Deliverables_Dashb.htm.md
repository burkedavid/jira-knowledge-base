##  Deliverables Dashboards

The Deliverables Management module is equipped with a set of deliverables
dashboards containing charts that allow you to gain valuable insight into your
projectâs health and drill down into the data to resolve any issues. You can
click on items in the legend to show and hide results, with hidden items shown
in gray. These dashboards are displayed on the Home page to Workspace
Administrators.

Note  Deliverables dashboards include all document versions by default. They
also include documents that you donât have explicit permissions to view
(similar to Advanced search with the Skip Document Security box checked). They
do not include attachments, deleted items or canceled placeholders.
