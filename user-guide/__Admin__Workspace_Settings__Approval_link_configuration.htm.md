###  Approval Link Configuration

When the approval process for a document is completed, FusionLive can
automatically create a link document in a specified folder.

This allows you to ensure the security of other documents held in the same
location while providing access only to the linked approval document.

Each approval status can be configured to provide a link to a different folder
structure location. At the end of the approval process for a document that
exists in a nominated source folder, a link will be created in the target
folder associated with the final approval status given to the document.

  1. In the Workspace Settings pane, click on Approval Link Configuration. 
  2. Select a status from the Approval Status drop-down menu, then press Add. 
  3. By default the link will be applied to approval documents anywhere in the workspace, but if you want to limit this link configuration to documents in a particular folder of the file structure, click on the Source Folder Location icon and select the required folder. 
  4. If you have selected a source folder, you can also extend the linkâs association to the folders contained within the nominated source folder. If you want to do this, check the Include Subfolders box. 
  5. Click on the Target Folder icon and select the location in the file structure in which the link document will appear. 
  6. Select the Link Type. 

Link Type  |  Description   
---|---  
Static  |  Links only to the version of the document which is current when the link is created.   
Dynamic  |  Always links to the current version even after the document is revised.   
  
  

  1. Repeat this procedure for all the approval links you want to configure, then press Apply.
