###  TQ numbering

Note  Available when Technical Query is enabled.

You can configure the format of an automatically generated TQ No. This
reference number is constructed from Parts and separators (see [ Edit
Reference field ](Edit_reference_f.htm#h) for more information on reference
numbers).Â

  1. In the Workspace Settings pane, press the TQ numbering button. 
  2. To create a new code table, press the New Code Table button. 
  3. If TQs have not yet been created for this workspace, you can add, remove and configure the order of parts to create the reference number format. To add a part to the reference number protocol, press the Insert Part button and select the location in the reference number, relative to any other parts, where the part is to be.Â 
  4. Select the Part type: 

Part type  |  Description  |  Instructions   
---|---|---  
Separator  |  Characters which delineate the parts of the reference number.   
Separators may consist of one or two characters. They can be any type of character, but most often are symbol characters. For example - / [ ] .  |  Enter the characters that you want to be used for this separator part.   
Selection  |  Allows the part to be determined by user input, involving options that you supply manually. The options are presented in the order listed here. You can change the order, as well as add or remove options.  |  Enter the Name of the part.   
Add an Entry for each option that users will be able to select for this part.
Each entry has a Code and a Label. The code is used internally in FusionLive.
The label is the option text presented to the user.  
Use the Up and Down buttons to change the position of an option.  
Counter  |  Provides a sequential count to ensure that all reference numbers are unique.Â   
The counter can be configured to count differently according to the selections of other parts of the reference number. For example, three types of drawing chosen from a Selection part may each have their own sequential count. You can choose the parts that effect a counter reset in this way.Â  |  Enter the name of the part.   
Enter the number of digits in the counter.  
Enter the number at which the counter should start.  
Enter the number at which the counter should end.  
Choose whether the counter should display leading zeros.  
Choose which other parts of the reference number effect a counter reset.
