###  Deactivate users

If you want to temporarily limit a user account from a workspace but not
remove it permanently, you can deactivate the account from that workspace. The
user will retain access to their other workspaces and can be reactivated on
this workspace at any time.

  1. In the Contacts page, search for the users. 
  2. Select the users that you want to deactivate. 
  3. Press the Workspace Action button and select Deactivate User From Workspace.
