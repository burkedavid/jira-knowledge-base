status. If the tag is a replacement for a superseded tag, any associations
carried forward are listed as separate actions.Â

  1. In the Tag Register page, click on the required Tag Number to open the Tag Information page. 
  2. Select Tag Audit from the Tag Info drop-down menu. The actions are listed with who performed them and the date. 
  3. To view the detail of what has changed as a result of an action, click on the Details link.Â 

If the action was a change to the tagâs metadata, the old and new values are
highlighted. If the action was to add or remove an association, carry forward
associations from a superseded tag or change status only the detail of the
change is shown.
