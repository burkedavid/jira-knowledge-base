###  Configure Contact Visibility

Note  Only available if the Contact Visibility setting is enabled.

By default, users from the companies using your workspace have access to the
contact details of users in other companies. However, you can make user
contact details unavailable by imposing a data security relationship between
two or more companies.

####  Create contact visibility relationship

In a contact visibility relationship:

  * the Source Company is the company whose users will not be able to access the contact details of the target companies 
  * Target Companies are the companies whose contact details will be hidden 

If you want contact visibility to be reciprocal between two companies, you
will need to set up two relationships.

  1. In the Contact Visibility page, press Create Relation. 
  2. Enter the name of the Source Company or select it from the drop-down menu. 
  3. To add a target company, enter some part of its name in the Target Company box and press Search. 
  4. Select the required companies from the search results and press Apply.
