###  Configure tag status

By default, the tag statuses available for use are: Active, Retired, Deleted,
Superseded and Void. These are of one of the following status types:Â

Status TypeÂ  |  Description   
---|---  
Active  |  Active tag statuses are currently in use. It is most common for active tag types to be made the default.   
Inactive  |  Inactive tag statuses are ones which have been used but have been replaced or withdrawn from use. By default these are, Retired or Void.   
SupersededÂ  |  When an individual tag is longer in use, it can be superseded by another tag. After this process the original tagâs associations are transferred to the replacement and the tag is given the Superseded status. There can be only one Superseded status type.   
Deleted  |  When an individual tag is deleted, if it has no associations it is deleted permanently from the workspace. If it has associations, it remains with the Deleted status and can have no further associations. There can be only one Deleted status type.   
  
  
You can add new statuses, edit the names of existing ones or delete ones that
are not required.
