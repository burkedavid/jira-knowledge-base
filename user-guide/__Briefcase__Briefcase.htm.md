#  Briefcase

The Briefcase is an area where you can store and access frequently used
documents from different workspaces. If you have a FusionLive Connect account,
documents stored in the briefcase automatically synchronize to your account
and may be downloaded to your mobile device from the Available tab of the
Offline page.

Note  Links in the Briefcase are always static. The Briefcase may contain
multiple links to more than one version of the same document.

The contents of your briefcase are private.
