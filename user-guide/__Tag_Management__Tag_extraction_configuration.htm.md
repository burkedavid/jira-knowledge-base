###  Tag extraction configuration

In order for tag extraction to work, a set of rules needs to be provided
called an Extraction Configuration. Extraction configurations are created in
the Idox DIW system and exported as ZIP files.Â

Workspace Administrators upload and manage these configurations.
Configurations can be published immediately or created in draft format first
and tested in your FusionLive workspace.

Note  It is recommended that the extraction config set is created and applied
before the work of tag extraction begins in the workspace.

  1. In the Administration page, select Extraction Configuration in the Tag Settings pane. 
  2. To open the Extraction Configuration site, press the Manage Extraction Configurations button.Â
