##  Quick Search

The Quick Search box in the FusionLive ribbon enables you to search the
workspace for documents that match a simple search term.Ã‚

Quick searching considers the Reference and Title fields of the current
versions of documents, parents and attachments. This is extended to Due Date
for workspaces where the Pre-register module is enabled and the Moved to
Outbox field for Inbox workspaces. When the Tag Management module is enabled,
document-to-tag associations are considered in addition to documents.

  1. Type the criterion you want to search on into the Quick Search box. 
  2. Press Enter on your keyboard.
