####  Reassign technical query

If there are users who you think should answer a query instead of you, you can
reassign the query to them.Â

Note  When you reassign a technical query to another user, it is removed from
your technical queries list.

  1. Select the relevant technical queries, then press the Reassign button. 
  2. Click on the Reassign To link and, in the Select Users window, add the people you want to reassign the request to. If you want to send a copy of the query to other users, add them to the Cc list. 
  3. When you reassign a technical query, you can request that when the query is answered it is returned to you for approval. To do this, check the Return to me for approval box. 
  4. In the Comment area, tell the user why youâre sending the query to them. 
  5. Press Send.
