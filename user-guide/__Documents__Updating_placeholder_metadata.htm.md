####  Updating placeholder metadataÂ

You can update the metadata information of placeholders just as you would
documents in the workspace.

  1. In the Documents page, select the folder containing the placeholders you want to update. 
  2. Double click on a placeholder to open its Document Info page. 
  3. Amend any metadata values as required.Â 

Note  The following characters cannot be used in metadata fields: \
/:*?<>=^"|'&

Note  If the category employs reference numbering, the reference field cannot
be revised.

Note  In a Deliverables Management workspace, the Originator field is
automatically filled with the name of your company. If the Allow Edit by
Multiple Originators feature is enabled, Originator can be changed. If this
feature is not enabled, only Document Controllers or Workspace Administrators
can do so.

  1. To update the placeholders now press Update.Â
