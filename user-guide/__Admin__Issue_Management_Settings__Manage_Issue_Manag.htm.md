###  Manage Issue Management Roles

Users of the Issue Management module perform different roles in creating,
managing and fixing defects.

RoleÂ Â Â  |  Description   
---|---  
Issue ManagerÂ  |  Adds relevant metadata to issues and assigns them to Issue Assignees. Also reassigns or rejects issues when required, and closes completed issues.   
Issue AssigneeÂ  |  Performs work on issues assigned to them and then hands them back for inspection. Can also create new issues if required.Â   
Optional permissions, typically given to Assignees who will subcontract issue
management work, include reassigning issues and changing issue types.  
Issue User  |  Records on-site defects by creating issues.
