###  Carry-forward behavior

When documents are revised, most of their deliverables management metadata is
carried forward to the new version. However, the carry-forward behavior of the
key project dates depends on the field and on the type of revision.

Deliverables documents can be revised in the following ways:

  * Revise (or check-in) without changing Reason for Issue 
  * Revise (or check-in) changing Reason for Issue 
  * Revise with comments 
  * Manually create a placeholder revision 
  * Submittal response with a Decision Code type that causes a placeholder to be created
