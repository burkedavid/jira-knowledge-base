###  Workspace Information

The Info page for a selected workspace comprises the following tabs:

  * Workspace Information - details of the selected workspace and a list of FusionLive administrators who can administer it 
  * Assigned to Workspace - lists the users from your company assigned to the workspace 
  * Not Assigned to Workspace - lists the users from your company available to be assigned to the workspace and allows you invite more 

  1. To view details about where and when the selected workspace was created, click on the Workspace Name tab. You can also view details about each workspace administrator by clicking on their name. 
  2. To view the users assigned to the selected workspace, click on the Assigned to Workspace tab. To view details about a workspace user, click on their name. 
  3. To view the users invited to work on the selected workspace, click on the Invited to Workspace tab. To view details about each user or the administrator who invited them, click on their name. 
  4. To invite users to the workspace, click on the Not Assigned to Workspace tab.Ã‚ 

Note  It is strongly recommended to create new users instead of inviting them.
The invitations require the new user to accept the invitation and the
workspace administrator to authorize the access. Creating a new user skips
these steps.

Select the person you want to invite from the list of unassigned users and
press the Invite User To Workspace button.

Invitations to join the workspace require authorization by an administrator.
Press the Send Request button to send the invitation for authorization.
