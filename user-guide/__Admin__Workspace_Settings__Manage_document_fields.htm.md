####  Manage document fields

New categories are created with a set of fields corresponding to standard
system properties shared by all documents. If the Deliverables Management
module is enabled, the fields available depend on the category type.

Note  Before a new document category can be activated, its Revision and Status
fields must be defined with appropriate selections.

You can edit some details of the property fields and add your own custom
fields.

  1. Open the preferences of a category and select the Manage Document Fields tab. 

The system and custom fields associated with the category are listed, along
with the field type and whether they are currently active, mandatory and
hidden on the upload screen. If a default value has been set, this will also
be displayed.

  1. The fields are listed in the order in which they will be displayed when users assign category metadata to their uploaded documents. You can change a fieldâs place in the display order by selecting a field row and pressing the Up or Down buttons. 
  2. When you have finished organizing the field order, press the Save Order button. 
  3. To edit the details of a field, click on the appropriate Preferences icon. The instructions for editing specific fields are described in the following sections.  Note  Only some of the properties of system fields can be edited. 
  4. You can delete custom fields that you no longer need (see [ Delete custom fields ](Delete_custom_f.htm#h) ).
