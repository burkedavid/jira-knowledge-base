##  Reviews

The Reviews activity type is a business process workflow which enables
documents to be submitted to users for review. Documents for review are
circulated singly and in PDF format, and must be responded to within a given
date. Once the participating reviewers have added their comments, the person
who started the review can close it.

The Reviews activity area is structured into Open and Closed folders, with the
following sub-folders:

  * Started By Me - reviews that were sent out by you 
  * Started By My Company - reviews that were sent out by your company 
  * Participate By Me - reviews that were sent to you for your comments
