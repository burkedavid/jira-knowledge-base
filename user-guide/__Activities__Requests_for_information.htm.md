##  Requests For Information (RFI)

The RFI activity type is a business process workflow which enables requests to
be submitted to users for information about project activities or documents.
You can provide an answer, add a comment or involve other users.

The RFIs activity area is structured into the following folders:

  * Assigned To Me - requests that have been sent to you to answer 
  * For My Comment - requests that have been sent to you for comment 
  * For My Information - requests that have been sent to you for your information 
  * Created By Me - requests that you have sent 
  * All Workspace RFIs - allows RFI administrators to view all queries for the workspace in one place
