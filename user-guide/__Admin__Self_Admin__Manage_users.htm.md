###  Manage users

The User Management section allows you to add new users, assign users to the
current workspace and perform a variety of administration tasks.

  1. In the Self Administration pane, select User Management. 
  2. Enter some search criteria in the filter fields and search for users by name, email address, company, workspace or status. Press Search. 

Note  Even if you are going to create a new user, you must search and make
sure that they do not already have a registered account (or an unregistered
one that has not yet been accepted or authorized). This avoids duplicate user
accounts.

Note  Users will not appear in the search if their company is excluded from
user searches. The search also only includes users from your extended network.
(Your extended network includes users from your company and users from
companies that are members of workspaces with your company.) Barred users will
not appear.

  1. The From field allows you select: 

  * All available companies - includes all companies associated with any FusionLive workspace owned by the company that owns the current workspace 
  * Current workspace only - includes only companies associated with the current workspace (this option enables a variety of administration options (see [ View user details ](View_user_deta.htm#h) )) 

  1. The users that match your search are displayed. To view a userâs details, click on their name.
