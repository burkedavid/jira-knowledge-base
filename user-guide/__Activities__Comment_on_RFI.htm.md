####  Comment on RFI

When an RFI is sent to you for comment, you are expected to make a response
that does not directly answer the query but may add useful background or other
additional information to the discussion.Â

RFIs sent for comment appear in your For My Comment folder. However, you can
also comment on RFIs that appear in any of your RFI lists.

  1. Select the RFI you want to comment on, then press the Add Comment button. 
  2. In the Comment box provide your thoughts about the RFI. 
  3. The Attachments area allows you to attach additional supporting documents to the RFI comment. Depending on the modules enabled for your workspace, these may be sourced either from the project folder structure or from your local system. Attachments sourced from project files are known as controlled documents and will be available to be viewed by other users in the workspace. However, if the documents are temporary and are not required to be added to the project they can attached as uncontrolled documents instead. 

Attachment typeÂ  |  Description   
---|---  
Attach a project documentÂ Â Â  |  Allows you to attach a controlled document that already exists in the workspace to your comment.   
Press Add and choose the relevant document from the workspace folder
structure.  
Upload an uncontrolled documentÂ  |  If the Allow Uncontrolled Attachments module is enabled, this allows you to attach an uncontrolled document from your local system to your comment. This document will not be added to the workspace.   
Press the Add Uncontrolled File button, select the relevant document and press
the Open button.

You can remove an attached document from your comment by selecting it in the
Attachments or Uncontrolled Documents lists and pressing the relevant Remove
button.
