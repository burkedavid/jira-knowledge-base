####  Comment on technical query

When a technical query is sent to you for comment, you are expected to make a
response that does not directly answer the query but may add useful background
or other additional information to the discussion.Â

Technical queries sent for comment appear in your For My Comment folder.
However, you can also comment on queries that appear in any of your technical
query folders.

  1. Select the technical query you want to comment on, then press the Add Comment button. 
  2. In the Comment box provide your thoughts about the query. 
  3. You can attach additional supporting documents to the comment. In the Attachments area, press Add and choose the relevant document from the workspace folder structure.Â 
  4. To finish, press the Submit Comment button.
