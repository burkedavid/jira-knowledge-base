####  Create a default location

You can specify a default hierarchy location which will be the first location
displayed when a user accesses Issue Management in FusionLive Connect. For
example, a particular building that is currently undergoing an inspection. If
no default is specified, the top level will be displayed instead.

The default location node is indicated in red and the default location path is
displayed at the top of the hierarchy.

  2. Click on Default Location. The hierarchy path for the default location is displayed at the top of the hierarchy tree. 
  3. To remove the default, click on the red X symbol.
