###  Move a Folder

In order to move a folder:

  * If the Folder Management setting is enabled, you must be a member of the Folder Administrators role 
  * You must also be a workspace administrator to move a folder to or from the root level 
  * You must also be a super administrator or assigned as an administrator or contributor for a secure folder on both the folder being moved and the folder to which it will be moved. 

Moving a secure folder uses the permissions from the destination folder (the
permissions on the folder being moved will be lost).

  1. In the Documents page, select a folder. 
  2. Press the Move a folder button in the navigation pane. 
  3. Browse the folder structure and select the folder into which you wish to relocate it. 
  4. Press Move.
