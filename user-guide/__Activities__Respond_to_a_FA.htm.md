###  Respond to a formal approval

When you receive a document for formal approval, you will review the documents
as well as any published comments and markups, and decide whether the document
should be accepted or rejected.

  1. In the Assigned To Me folder, select the formal approval you want to respond to. 
  2. If the documents have undergone a formal review they will have a Decision Code that will indicate whether the reviewers thought the document should be accepted or rejected. You can also view the published review comments by clicking on the Comments link. 
  3. Open the documents to view their contents.Â 
  4. If markups have been added, select each document and press View to view the consolidated markup. 
  5. To make an approval decision, select each document and press Approve or Reject.Â 

The documents move from the Not Responded section to the Responded section.
The lifecycle status of the document changes to Approved or Rejected. Once a
document has a response, no other approvers can add a response.

If all of the documents have a response, then the approval moves to Closed.
