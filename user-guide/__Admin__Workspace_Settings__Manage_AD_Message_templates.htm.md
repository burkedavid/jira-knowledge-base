###  Manage AD Message Templates

Note  Available when Automatic Distribution is enabled.

When documents are distributed automatically as messages according to the
rules of the distribution matrix, they are accompanied by a message telling
the recipients why they are receiving the documents. You can configure a
series of message templates that can be called to fulfill this purpose under
selected circumstances.

Note  These message templates populate the message content. The message
subject comes from the distribution matrix spreadsheet.

  1. In the Workspace settings pane, press Manage AD Message Template. 
  2. To view and edit a template, click on the Preferences icon beside its name. 
  3. To delete a template, click on the Delete icon beside its name. 
  4. To create a new template, press the Create message template button. 
  5. Enter a Template name. 
  6. Type the content of the message, using the FusionLive text editor to style the text as required (see [ Text editor options ](../../Overview/Text_editor_options.htm#h) ). 
  7. To include the distribution code in the message (for example, For Information), place the cursor in the message where you want the code to appear and check the Add distribution code box at the top of the page. 
  8. To create the template, press Apply.
