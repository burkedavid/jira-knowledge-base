####  Change Workspace Status

When you create or clone a workspace, its default status is Rollout. In order
for the workspace to be accessible by users, it must be changed to Live. Note
You can only change the status for workspaces that you initiated.

  1. In the Self Administration area, open Workspaces. 
  2. In your Workspaces list the status of each workspace is displayed. Select the workspace whose status you want to update and press the Edit Workspace button in the menu bar. 
  3. From the Workspace Status drop-down menu, select Live. 
  4. Press Apply.Ã‚
