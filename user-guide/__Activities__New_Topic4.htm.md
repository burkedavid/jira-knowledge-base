###  Consolidate formal review comments

As a consolidator, you will be notified when all of the reviews have been
completed and the review is ready for you to consolidate, although you can
consolidate markups at any time during the review.

  1. In the Assigned To Me folder, locate the formal reviews whose markup comments you want to consolidate. 
  2. If markups have been added to a document, select it and press View. Use the Viewer tools to review the markups that have been created by other members of the review. You can create a consolidated markup layer containing elements of other markups if you want (see [ Consolidate markups ](../Documents/Consolidate_markups_\(new_viewer\).htm#h) ). 
  3. Press the Complete Review button.Â 
  4. For each document, select a Decision Code. The decision codes available to you will depend on your workspace and the review type.Â 
  5. Press the Complete Review button. The Consolidation status for each reviewed document changes to Completed.
