###  Resubmit content

If the decision code type of the submittal response was Rejected or Accepted -
Provide Content, then the documents are given the Returned status and a
placeholder is created as a new version of the returned document. To resubmit
a returned document, you must first upload it as content to this placeholder
before adding it to a new submittal.Ã‚
