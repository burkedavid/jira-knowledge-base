####  Markup List

If a document contains markups, these are listed in the Markup List.

  1. On the Documents page, locate the document whose list of markups you want to view and double click to open its Document Information page. 
  2. From the Document Info drop-down menu, select Markup List to view a list of the documentâs markups. 

Note  The Viewer Format column indicates if the markup was made on the Old
viewer or New viewer.

Note  If Rendition Security is enabled, all of the markups are made on the
documentâs rendition, not the native document itself.
