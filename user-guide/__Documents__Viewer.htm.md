###  Viewer

The FusionLive Viewer allows you to view documents independently of their
native application. This most often applies to drawing files (output from
applications such as AutoCAD or MicroStation) circulated for review and
comment to non-drawing personnel. You can add text and annotation markups,
compare documents and publish versions of marked-up documents. The following
file types are supported.

Note  If the file type is .IFC and you have a BIM application installed,
FusionLive Viewer will open the BIM-type file in that application.Â

  1. To open a document in Viewer, select View from the Document Actions menu. 

Alternatively, you can click on a View button associated with a document list
or click on the glasses icon next to a documentâs title.

To open a document in Viewer on an Android or iOS mobile device, select View
Mobile.

Note  If Rendition Security is enabled and you have the Native Users role,
select View Native to open the native document in the Viewer. Otherwise,
select View to view its rendition. If you do not have this role you cannot
select View Native. Under Rendition Security, markups can only be made on the
rendition. Therefore, View Native opens the Viewer in read-only mode.

Note  FusionLive documents can also be displayed by passing document
information directly via a URL. These documents are always read-only. For more
information, see the FusionLive Web Service Reference Guide.
