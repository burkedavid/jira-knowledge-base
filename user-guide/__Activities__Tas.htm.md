###  Task Folders

Unlike other activities, the folders in which your tasks will appear are not
automatically added to your Activities page. You will need to search for tasks
in ways that are appropriate to the way you work, save those searches and mark
them as favorites. When you have done that, the favorite searches will appear
as folders in the Tasks area of your Activities page.

  1. To add a folder to your Tasks area, press the New Search button in the Tasks toolbar. 
  2. Use the tasks search page (see [ Task Search ](Task_Search.htm#h) ) to locate a particular selection of tasks (for example, all tasks assigned to you, all tasks assigned by your team or late tasks for a specific sub-project). 
  3. Perform the search, then save it. 
  4. On the Task Search Manager page, highlight the saved search and press Add to Favorites (see [ Add to Favorites ](Add_to_fav.htm#h) ).
