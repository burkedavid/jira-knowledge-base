#####  Add fields and measures

Chart reports work best when they are simple. For example, plotting field data
against an appropriate measure. In such a scenario, the fields would be added
to the columns axis and the corresponding measures, which should share a
sensible scale (for example, numbers of documents) added to the rows axis.Â

Note  If you need to display data of different types on the same chart, use a
dual/multi-axis chart.

  1. In the Fields pane on the left hand side, select the fields you want to add and drag them into the Columns box in the layout band. Alternatively, right click on the fields and select Add to Columns.Â

  1. In the Measures pane, select the measures you want to add and drag them into the Rows box in the layout band. Alternatively, right click on the measures and select Add to Rows.Â 
  2. The fields are organized in logical sets (for example, Document Information, User Information). If you want to add all of the fields in a set to a column or row, right click on the set name and select Add to Columns or Add to Rows. 
  3. The columns and rows are created from left to right. To change the order, select a field in the layout band and drag it to the desired location. 
  4. When you have more than one field in a column or row, you can select the number of fields that are displayed on that axis by adjusting the Data Level slider.Â

Note  This is contained in the Filters pane, but is not associated with the
other filter controls (see [ Filters ](new_topic5.htm#h) ).

  1. If you would prefer that the measures are presented on the horizontal axis and the fields on the vertical axis, you can swap the axes by pressing the Switch the groups button in the menu bar.
