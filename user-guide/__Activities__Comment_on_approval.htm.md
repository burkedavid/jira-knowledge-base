####  Comment on approval or submittal

When you have assessed one or more documents circulated with each approval in
a submittal package, you can make a comment and recommend an action for
closing the approval. For example, that the documents should be approved. You
can comment on approvals individually, or comment on the entire submittal
package with a single action.

If advanced approval commenting is enabled, you may add multiple comments.
