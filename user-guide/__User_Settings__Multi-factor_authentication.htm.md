####  Multi-factor authentication

If the owning company of any workspace you are a member of requires the
additional security of multi-factor authentication, you will need to perform a
secondary authentication step.Â

Note  Multi-factor authentication is not required if your organization uses
Single sign-on log in.

To see which companies have enabled this security feature, click on the Why am
I required to use Multi-Factor Authentication? link.

#####  Set up multi-factor authentication

The first time you are asked to log in with multi-factor authentication the
login page will prompt you to set up an authenticator app on your smartphone
or tablet. FusionLive supports Microsoft Authenticator or Google
Authenticator.Â

You can also do this later from your My Profile page, if you prefer (see [
Multi-factor authentication details ](Multi-factor_authentication_details.htm)
).

Note  If you do not want to use an authenticator app you can have the
verification code sent to your registered email address instead.

  1. If you do not already have an authenticator app on your device, download and install one. 
  2. To link the authenticator app to FusionLive, open the app, add a new account and select to scan a QR code. 
  3. Use your phone to scan the QR code on the login page. If you cannot scan the QR code, sign in to the account manually and enter the unique key from the login page when asked. 
  4. The app will generate a one-time verification code. Enter that into the box on the login page and press Continue.Â 
  5. If you do not want to use an authenticator app, click on the link, No device? Send a verification code to my registered email. When you receive the email, copy the one-time verification code into the box and press Continue. 

#####  Log in with multi-factor authentication

  1. Log in with your username and password. 
  2. Open the authenticator app on your mobile device and type the one-time verification code into the box on the login page. 
  3. Alternatively, click on the link, No device? Send a verification code to my registered email. When you receive the email, copy the one-time verification code into the box. 
  4. Press Continue.
