####  BIM model topics

If the Internal Viewer Topics feature is enabled, you can create topics to
track issues in BIM models, and also view and comment on those raised by other
users. Topics are organized into groups known as Boards.

When you create a topic you can add your current view of the model as a
snapshot of a viewpoint. Other users will be able to recreate the viewpoint to
understand the subject of the topic.
