###  Reassign a formal review

As lead reviewer you can reassign a review to another user to perform the lead
reviewer duties. This can also be done by the review initiator or the
Deliverables Activity administrator.

  1. In the Assigned To Me folder (or from the Review Details page) select the documents under review that you want to reassign to another user.  Note  If you select more than one document, the user you invite will become the lead reviewer for all of the selected reviews. 
  2. From the Assign drop-down menu, select Reassign.Â 
  3. Click on Assign To. Select the required workspace user, press Add to move them to the For Comment column and press Apply. 
  4. If you need to give the new lead reviewer more time to close the review, click on the Review Due Date and select a new date from the date picker. 
  5. Press the Send button to pass the lead reviewer duties for the selected reviews to the selected user.Â 

The new lead reviewer will receive a notification and the review will move to
the former lead reviewerâs For Information folder.
