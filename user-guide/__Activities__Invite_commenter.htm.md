###  Invite additional commenters

While a formal review is in progress the review initiator, lead reviewer,
Document Activity administrator or any user already invited to comment on the
review can invite additional users to comment.

  1. In the appropriate Formal Review folder select the documents under review that you want to invite users to comment on.  Note  If you select more than one document, the users you invite will be added to all of the selected reviews. 
  2. From the Assign drop-down menu, select Additional Commenters. 
  3. Click on Additional Commenters. Select the required workspace users, press Add to move them to the For Comment column and press Apply. 
  4. The original Comment Due Date is displayed. If you need to give the new commenters more time to review the document, click on the Comment Due Date and select a new date from the date picker. 

Note  Only the initiator, lead reviewer or Deliverables Activity administrator
can change the due date.

  1. Press the Send button to invite the new users to comment on the selected reviews. 

In the Reviews Completed counter, the total number of expected reviews is
increased.
