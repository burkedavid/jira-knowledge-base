###  Assign consolidator

If a consolidator was not assigned when the formal review was created the
review initiator, lead reviewer, or Document Activity administrator can add
one while it is in progress. The consolidator may select which markups made by
the commenters will be published.

Note  A consolidator cannot close a review or reassign the consolidation role
to a lead reviewer. You can use this process to reassign another user as
consolidator. You will be retained as a for information user.

  1. In the appropriate Formal Review folder select the documents under review that you want to invite a user to consolidate.  Note  If you select more than one document, the user you invite will be assigned to all of the selected reviews. 
  2. From the Assign drop-down menu, select Consolidator. 
  3. Click on For Consolidation and select the required workspace user. Press Add to move them to the For Consolidation column and press Apply. 
  4. If the formal review does not already have a consolidator, the Consolidation Due Date will be populated with the Planned Review Date.Ã‚ Alternatively, if you are reassigning the consolidator role, this date will be the original Consolidation Due Date. To change this, click on the Consolidation Due Date and select a new date from the date picker. 
  5. Press the Send button to invite the selected user to consolidate the comments for the selected reviews. They will receive a notification and email alert accordingly. 

In the Formal Review activity area, the consolidator is listed and the
consolidation status is changed to Pending.
