###  Linking

A link is an image of a document stored elsewhere in the workspace. It allows
access to the document to users who do not have access to its location (for
example, because it is in a secure folder). Only the link can be viewed, no
other contents of the folder it is stored in can be accessed. Viewing a
documentâs link is the same as viewing the document itself.

Note  Lifecycle status security does not apply to Links. Users see links even
if they do not have viewer permission to the status.

A link can be an independent object or it can be an attachment to another
document.Â

A Link icon next to a document indicates whether it is a link or whether a
link exists for it.

![](../images/linked documents linked version.png) Â Is Link - a link which
points to a document elsewhere (often in a secure folder) in the workspace.

![](../images/linked doc original.png) Â Has Link - there is a link present in
another (usually more accessible) area of the workspace that points to this
document.

Links are either static or dynamic.Â Â Â

Link Type  |  Description   
---|---  
Dynamic  |  Links to the latest version of the document. When new versions of the linked document are created, the link will be updated.Â   
StaticÂ Â Â  |  Links only to the selected version of the document and does not update when new versions are created.Â

Note  In standard operation, when you link to a document that has attachments,
the attachments will also be visible to users of the link. However, this
functionality can be turned off for individual workspaces. Workspace
Administrators should contact support to request this.
