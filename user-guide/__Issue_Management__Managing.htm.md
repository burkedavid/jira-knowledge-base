##  Managing the Issue Lifecycle

Issue Managers are responsible for managing the status of each issue as it
progresses through the lifecycle from creation to being assigned to an Issue
Assignee, to being resolved and inspected, and then finally closed.

As a result of the actions of the Issue Manager and Issue Assignee, issues can
therefore be in one of the following statuses.Â

StatusÂ Â Â  |  Description   
---|---  
New  |  Issue has been created but not yet assigned.   
Open  |  Issue has been assigned to an Issue Assignee.   
Ready To InspectÂ  |  Issue Assignee has resolved the issue and it is ready to be inspected.   
Declined  |  Issue Assignee has declined the invitation to work on this issue. It must be assigned again.   
Closed  |  Issue has been inspected and passed as successfully resolved.Â   
Rejected  |  Issue does not need to be resolved.

###  Assigning an issue

Once a new issue has been created, the Issue Manager must assign it to someone
with the skills and knowledge to resolve it. You can assign multiple new
issues at once.Â

Additionally, Issue Assignees with the Manage Reassigns permission can assign
issues that they have received to another user.

  1. As an Issue Manager, in the Issue List select one or more issues in the New state. 
  2. Select Assign from the Actions menu. 
  3. The Assign Issues window displays the issues that will be assigned along the top. Hover the mouse over an issue to view its details. 
  4. Select an Issue Type from the Issue Type Hierarchy tree on the left. 
  5. Enter the Issue Properties on the right. 

PropertyÂ Â Â  |  Description   
---|---  
Assignee CompanyÂ Â  |  Select the company that will be responsible for resolving the issue.   
Assignee User  |  Select the user from the Assignee Company assigned to resolving the issue.   
Priority  |  Select the priority level for the issue.   
Due DateÂ Â  |  Select the date by which the issue must be resolved. By default this will be todayâs date plus the resolution period associated with the priority level, but you can change this.Â   
  
  
Fill any additional fields.
