#  Tag Management

FusionLive Tag Management enables you to extract and import tag information
from engineering drawings and manage the association of those tags with
FusionLive documents and purchasing information. Documents containing tags can
be sent on Formal Review and the tags validated or rejected in the FusionLive
viewer.Â

The Tag Register screen displays a filterable list of all tags in the
workspace along with their metadata and relationships to documents, purchase
orders and other tags.
