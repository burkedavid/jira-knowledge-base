###  Unrestricted attachment types

Note  Not available on Business Rules or Inbox workspaces.

When you share documents with certain users FusionLive allows you to control
the types of attachments they are allowed to see.

This is done by adding those users and groups to the Restricted Users role,
and permitting them to see only specified types of file when those file types
are used as attachments.

For example, you may wish restricted users to be able to view a published
rendition of a document but not the native. In this case, if a parent document
has two attachments, the published rendition (PDF) and the native (DOC), by
adding PDF to the Unrestricted Attachment Types list but not DOC, users added
to the Restricted Users role will only see the PDF attachment. Users not on
that role will see both attachments.

  1. In the Workspace Settings panel, click on Unrestricted Attachment Types. The file types available to restricted users for the workspace are listed. 
  2. To add a file type to the Unrestricted Attachment Types list, click on the Add File Type. 
  3. Select a file type from the drop-down menu and press Apply. 
  4. To remove a file type from the list, click on the relevant Delete icon.
