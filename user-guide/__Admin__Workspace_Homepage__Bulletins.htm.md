###  Bulletins

You can create information bulletins comprised of text and links that
workspace users will be able to read in their Bulletins pane. When you first
create a bulletin, its status is saved. It can be edited at any time until it
is posted. Once a bulletinâs expiry date has been reached, it becomes
archived.

Page Is Active setting must be enabled (see [ Workspace Details
](../Workspace_Settings/Workspace_Deta.htm#h) ).
