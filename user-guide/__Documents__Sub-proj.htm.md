###  Sub-projects

Note  Sub-projects are only available when the Programme Management module is
enabled.

You can create sub-projects within your folder structure to help organize
programmes of work within the larger project. Sub-projects allow teams of
nominated users to work on specified folders and perform tasks.Ã‚

####  Creating a Sub-project

Project templates are created by workspace administrators and one of these
templates, combined with project roles and attributes, is used as the basis
for your sub-project.

  1. In the folder structure, select the root folder with which you want to associate the sub-project. 
  2. Press the Subproject button in the navigation pane. 
  3. Select the Project Template that you want to base your sub-project on, then press Next. 
  4. Provide the sub-project with a unique Code and Name and give a short Description. 
  5. Choose whether the status of the project is initially Active or Inactive. 
  6. Enter a Start Date for the project. 
  7. Complete any Project Specific Attribute fields, then press Next. 
  8. In the Setup Participants page, add users to the Administrator, Contributor and Viewer categories. These users form your project Team. 
  9. When you have completed your team, press the Create button. 

The folder icon now changes to a Project Folder icon.
