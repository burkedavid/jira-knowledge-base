#####  Sub-project folders

When a sub-project is created from a template, a special folder is created at
a selected place in the folder structure. The sub-project folder may also
contain a hierarchy of sub-folders which are copied from the template. The
root sub-project folder takes the name you have given to the sub-project and
the root folder is secure, meaning that you can choose which user groups have
access to it.

  1. Select the root sub-project folder in the folder tree and press Edit Folder. 
  2. Define the sub-project security by selecting which user groups can be Administrators, Contributors or Viewers to the sub-project and pressing the appropriate Add button to add them the relevant lists. 

When you have finished, press Update.

  1. To add a sub-folder, press the Add Folder button.Ã‚ 
  2. Enter the name of the folder in the Folder Name box. 
  3. By default sub-folders inherit the security settings of their parent folder. If you want a sub-folder to have its own security, check the Secure Folder box and Add and Remove user groups as required. 
  4. Press Create to add the sub-folder to the folder structure. 
  5. Continue to add more sub-folders until your folder structure is complete, then press Next.
