#####  Create data feed

You can export your search via either public or private secure link which
allows non-FusionLive users or third party websites to view the search results
in XML format. If you choose Private Feed, the recipient will be required to
provide credentials to view the tasks.

  1. To create a data feed link for a search, press the Public Data Feed or Private Data Feed button associated with that saved search. 
  2. The link URL is displayed in the Feed Results window. Highlight the link and copy it to your clipboard. 
  3. You can now paste the link into an email to send to another user, or use it in an Excel web query or in some other medium.
