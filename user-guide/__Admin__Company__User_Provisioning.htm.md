####  User Provisioning

User provisioning allows changes made in your organizationâs active
directory to be automatically reflected in FusionLive. New users are
automatically added to the default workspace but still require to be added to
other relevant workspaces, as well as roles and groups. Users in the active
directory will be locked out of FusionLive. If you want to remove them
completely, you will still need to reassign their permissions and remove them
from FusionLive.

You must be a Company Administrator to perform these actions.

  1. In the Company Information pane of the Admin page, select User Provisioning. 
  2. Your active directory provider requires a token generated in FusionLive. This should always be hidden and only ever shared securely. To generate the token, click on the refresh icon next to the Token field. 

Copy the token and paste it into the appropriate field in your providerâs
set up.

Note  This should only need to be done once. Once user provisioning is
enabled, do not regenerate the token.Â

  1. Select the mandatory default settings for new users.
