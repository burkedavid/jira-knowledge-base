###  Revise an issued document with comments

Note  Non-business rules workspaces only.

When a document has been sent on a issue transmittal, you can revise the
document with a new version.

Note  Documents cannot be revised with comments if they are currently on a
formal review or formal approval.Â

  1. Select the document in the Documents page and choose Revise with Comments from the Document Actions menu. 
  2. Locate the new version of the document and press Open. 
  3. When the Upload Status is Ready, press Next. 
  4. Since you are revising this document, on the Files page, you cannot change the Category. You may supply an attachment at this stage, if required. Press Next. 
  5. On the Metadata page, depending on your category you may be able to change or add some of the metadata. Press Next. 
  6. The final page displays the revised document details, including the decision code and lifecycle status, Issued, inherited from the previous version. To change the decision code or status for the new version, click in the appropriate fields and select new values.Â 

Note  If a PM status is associated with the selected decision code, the PM
status field will be populated with that code. However, you can select a
different one if required.

  1. Press Update.
