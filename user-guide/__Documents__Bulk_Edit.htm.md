###  Bulk edit information

Since documents of the same category present the same metadata fields, it is
possible to select multiple document and change their metadata information in
one place.

  1. Open the Documents page. 
  2. Select several documents belonging to the same category. 
  3. From the Document Actions menu, select Edit Info. 
  4. In the Bulk Edit window, make the required changes to the metadata information. 

Note  In a Deliverables Management workspace, the Originator field is
automatically filled with the name of your company. If the Allow Edit by
Multiple Originators feature is not enabled, Originator cannot be changed
except by a Document Controller or Workspace Administrator.

  1. You can remove multiple documents too. Check the appropriate boxes to select the documents you want to remove and then select Remove Selected from the Remove Documents menu. 

To remove all of the documents in the Bulk Edit window, select Remove All from
the Remove Documents menu.

  1. When you have finished editing the document metadata, press the Update button.
