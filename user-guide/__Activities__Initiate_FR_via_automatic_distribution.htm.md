####  Initiate a Formal Review via Automatic Distribution

If the Automatic Distribution module is enabled, a distribution matrix
uploaded (see [ Distribution matrix
](../User_Settings/Distribution_matrix.htm#h) ) and a distribution code
created for the Digital Copy - Formal Review action (see [ Manage Distribution
Codes ](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Manage_d.htm#h) ), you can send documents
on formal review automatically. The recipients will be those identified by the
distribution matrix and the review due dates will be calculated according to
the document categoryâs turnaround periods.

  1. Open the submittal containing the documents you want to send for review via automatic distribution. 
  2. Select the documents from the Not Responded area. 
  3. Click on Activities and select Automatic Distribution. The names of the reviewers, commenters and recipients for information are automatically supplied according to the distribution matrix and the due dates are calculated according to the document categoryâs turnaround periods. You can amend these details if required and also add a message.Â 
  4. Press Send.
