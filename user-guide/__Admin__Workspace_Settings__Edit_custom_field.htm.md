#####  Edit custom field details

The details you configure in a new custom property field will depend on the
data type chosen. As a minimum, you must make a field active before it can be
used.  Note  Once a custom property has been created, you cannot change its
Type.

  1. In the Manage Document Fields tab, press the Preferences button for the custom property you want to edit. 
  2. If you want to edit the name of the property, type a new name in the Field Name box. 
  3. The field has to be activated before it will be available for use when uploading documents to the document category. To activate the field, check the Active box. 

If you want to hide the field from users of this document category, you can
uncheck the Active box.

  1. To make the custom property a mandatory field, tick the Is a Mandatory Field checkbox. 
  2. If the Clear on Revise setting is enabled for the workspace, then the field can be configured to be cleared on revise. When a user uploads a new version of a document, you can choose whether the contents of a custom metadata field should remain populated with the old value, or should be cleared. To clear the field when the document is revised, check the Clear On Revise box. 
  3. If the selected data type is Text, you can select whether the text field is restricted to a single line or takes multiple lines. Check the Multiline box if you want it to take multiple lines. 
  4. If the selected data type is Multiple Value or Drop Down, you must enter the values that the user will be able to pick from. Press the Add button and enter a name for the selection option then press Apply. You can change the order the options are presented in by selecting a row and using the Up and Down buttons to change its position. 

To remove an option from the list, select it and press Remove.

To display one option as the default value, select it and press Make Default

  1. If the data type is Text, Number or Date, you can display a default value when the field is presented. To do this enter something appropriate in the Default Value box. 
  2. If the selected data type is Code Table, select the relevant code table from the Link To Table drop-down menu. The code table values are displayed. 
  3. To hide a custom field from being displayed on the Upload screen, check the Hide on upload box.Ã‚ 

Note  You cannot hide reference, title, revision, status, reason for issue, PM
status, mandatory fields or fields linked to the reference.

Note  If you hide a field used as the source in a constraint pick list, the
constraints will not be applied.

  1. Press Apply.
