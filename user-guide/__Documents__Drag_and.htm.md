####  Drag and Drop upload

You can also upload by dragging and dropping multiple documents from your
desktop to FusionLive.

Note  The maximum file size for documents to upload is 9GB.

  1. On your local PC or network, browse to the location of the files you want to upload. 
  2. In FusionLive, open the Documents page and navigate the file structure to locate the folder you want to upload the documents into. 
  3. Select the documents and drag them to the folder.  Note  When dragging a group of files, click and drag the top file of the selection to ensure the files are presented in the same order in the Upload window. 
  4. Continue with the upload process relevant to your workspace (see [ Uploading documents ](Uploading_documents.htm#h) and [ Upload with Business Rules ](Upload_with_Business_Rules.htm#h) ).
