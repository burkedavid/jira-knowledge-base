####  Manage location hierarchy levels

When you imported the location hierarchy, the top row of the spreadsheet
defined the names of the levels in the hierarchy (for example, Level1, Level2,
and so on). You can change these to something suitable for your application
and apply a minimum mandatory level at which issues must be recorded.

  1. Click on the Manage Levels tab to view the hierarchy levels. The Level Index indicates the order of the levels in the hierarchy, with 1 being the most general, 2 being the next level down, and so on. 
  2. To edit a level, click on its Edit button. 
  3. To rename a level, edit the Level Name field. 
  4. The minimum mandatory level is the lowest level in the hierarchy which must be recorded when an issue is created. For example, if the minimum mandatory level was Floor, a user creating an issue could not record the issue simply at City level. Lower levels than the mandatory level can be recorded, but this is optional. 

By default the minimum mandatory level is the level of the Default Location.
Note The minimum mandatory level must have at least one populated node in
every branch of the hierarchy.

To make the current level mandatory, check the Is Mandatory box. All the
levels above this level will also be made mandatory.

To make the current level no longer mandatory, uncheck the Is Mandatory box.
Any mandatory levels below this level will also be made non-mandatory.Ã‚
