###  Standard BI Reports

A set of standard BI Reports collecting personal, project, company, workspace
and other data is provided. The reports available to you in the BI Reports tab
depend upon your access rights in FusionLive. Standard reports can be run on
demand or scheduled to run at specified times (see [ Standard BI Reports
](../Reports/BI.htm#h) ).

###  Custom BI Reports

To supplement the standard reports you can create reports to monitor the
document and activity information of interest to you. In addition to being run
and scheduled, custom BI Reports can be shared, edited or deleted.Â

Your custom BI Reports can only be seen by you and anyone you share them
with.Â
