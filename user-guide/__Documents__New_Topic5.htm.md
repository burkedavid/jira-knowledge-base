####  Associations

If a drawing contains references to other drawings (for example, a CAD drawing
file may have references to several raster images or underlay PDFs), these
associated files will be shown in the Associations tab. It is important to
understand these associations because changes you make to a drawing may affect
its parents or children.Â

Note  Associations that you do not have permissions to view will be grayed out
and cannot be viewed.

  1. On the Documents page, locate the document whose associations you want to view and double click to open its Document Information page. 
  2. From the Document Info drop-down menu, select Associations to view the documentâs parent and child references.
