##  Technical Queries

The Technical Query activity type is a business process workflow which enables
technical enquiries to be submitted to other users. You can provide an answer,
add a comment or involve other users.

The technical query activity area is structured into the following folders:

  * Assigned To Me - requests that have been sent to you to answer 
  * For My Comment - requests that have been sent to you for comment 
  * Created By Me - requests that you have sent 
  * All Workspace TQs - allows TQ administrators to view all queries for the workspace in one place
