#####  Enable document access for Formal Review recipients setting

When creating a formal review, you cannot add a user to the review who does
not have at least Viewer access to the review documents in the workspace.
However, you can enable users without permission to view the documents
temporarily for the duration of the formal review.Â

When the review Sender selects a user or a group containing a user who does
not have permission to view one or more of the review documents, they will be
informed when they try to send the review. If they continue, that user will be
given Viewer permission to the review documents and will be able to access
them via the Formal Review page until they have completed their part in the
review and the review is closed. If the Lead Reviewer is given access in this
way, once the review is closed this security restriction will prevent them
from publishing the review documents and comments.

Note  This setting will only apply to formal reviews created after it was
enabled.

  1. In the Workspace Settings tab of the Admin page, click on Deliverables. 
  2. Select the Review Configuration tab. 
  3. Check the Enable document access for Formal Review recipients box.Â 
  4. Press Apply.
