The FusionLive Search pages allow you to locate project documents and tasks by
entering an appropriate combination of search criteria.

The criteria used to search documents will vary according to how the workspace
has been set up and the enabled functionality. You can search the entire
workspace including all folders and document versions.

There are two primary modes of searching:

  * [ Quick Search ](Quick_Search.htm#h) \- find project documents matching a single piece of information. 
  * [ Advanced Search ](Advanced_Search.htm#h) \- choose one of a number of search types and supply a combination of criteria to search on.
