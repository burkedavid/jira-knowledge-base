####  Turnaround Periods

The Deliverables lifecycle for documents in externally submitted categories
involves activities such as the review, return and resubmission of documents.
You can set up turnaround periods to automatically calculate the dates when
these activities should occur based on the dates the document is first
submitted and its revisions received.

Turnaround PeriodÂ  |  Description   
---|---  
Planned Review  |  Number of days after the Actual Submission Date by which the document must be reviewed. This will calculate the Planned Review Date.   
Planned Return  |  If the review requires the document to be returned and resubmitted, the number of days after the Actual Reviewed Date by which the document must be returned to the external party. This will calculate the Planned Return Date.   
Planned Resubmission  |  Number of days after the Actual Returned Date by which the document must be resubmitted. This will calculate the Planned Resubmission Date.   
Consolidation Due  |  Number of days after the Actual Submission Date by which the document markups must be consolidated. This will calculate the Consolidation Due Date.Â   
Note  Cannot be larger than the Planned Review days. If this field is left
empty, the Consolidation Due Date is the same as the Planned Review Date.  
Comment DueÂ Â  |  Number of days after the Actual Submission Date by which comments on the document must be made. This will calculate the Comment Due Date.   
Note  Cannot be larger than the Planned Review days. If this field is left
empty, the Comment Due Date is the same as the Planned Review Date.
