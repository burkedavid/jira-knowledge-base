###  Submittal Numbering

Note  Available when Submittals is enabled.

You can configure numbering schemes for your deliverables submittals. If the
submittal numbering scheme is altered, the new scheme will be applied to all
new submittals, but not to submittals that already exist.

  1. In the Workspace Settings panel, select Submittal Numbering. 
  2. To add a part to the submittal number, press the Insert Part button and select its location in the submittal number, relative to any other parts.Â 
  3. Select the Part type: 

Part type  |  Description  |  Instructions   
---|---|---  
Separator  |  Characters which delineate the parts of the submittal number. Separators may consist of one or two characters. They can be any type of character, but most often are symbol characters. For example - / [ ] .  |  Enter the characters for this separator part.   
Selection  |  Allows the part to be determined by user input, involving options that you supply manually. The options are presented in the order listed here. You can change the order, as well as add or remove options.Â  |  Enter the Name of the part.   
Add an Entry for each option that users will be able to select for this part.
Each entry has a Code and a Label. The code is used internally in FusionLive.
The label is the option text presented to the user.  
Use the Up and Down buttons to change the position of an option.  
Company Code  |  The code identifying the company of the user who issued the submittal.   
Note  When you send a submittal on behalf of another user, the Company Code part of the submittal number will be for their company, not yours.Â  |  Company code cannot be edited.   
Counter  |  Provides a sequential count to ensure that all submittal numbers are unique.  |  The Counter part cannot be edited or deleted.
