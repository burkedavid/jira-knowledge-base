The Issue Management module allows users to raise issues relating to precise
physical locations. In order to be able to do this, you must define a location
hierarchy. The location hierarchy can be constructed manually or imported via
an Excel spreadsheet.

A location hierarchy is a top-down set of location levels which describe the
physical location that an issue may be found at. In FusionLive this is
presented as a collapsible tree similar to a hierarchy of document folders.
The levels of the hierarchy go from large scale to small. For example, Level 1
might be geographical region (for example, the Americas), Level 2, Country,
Level 3, City and so on down to a specific room in a building.

Each location in a hierarchy is identified by a location name and a unique
location code. The location code can be used, for example, in reports and
issue numbering.
