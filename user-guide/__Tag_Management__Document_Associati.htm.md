###  Document Associations

The Document Associations tab on the Tag Information page allows members of
the Tag Managers and Tag Viewers roles to view the documents associated with
the selected tag. Tag Managers can add and remove associations. Tag Viewers
can only view the association details and document information, and download
or view the documents.

  1. In the Tag Register page, click on the required Tag Number to open the Tag Information page. 
  2. If the Document Associations tab is not open, select it from the Tag Info drop-down menu.Â 
  3. The Document filter list displays the number of associated documents being displayed. You can filter the list to show documents, placeholders or all documents. 
  4. The Document Associations tab header displays the number of documents associated with the tag and the relevant details of those documents are listed in the pane. These details include the document reference, title and revision and also items specific to the association. 

MetadataÂ Â Â  |  Description   
---|---  
VersionÂ Â Â  |  The document version the tag is associated with.   
Associated Versions  |  The number of versions of the document the tag has been associated with, including the current one.   
Click on the Associated Versions number to view all versions of the document
with the associated versions highlighted.  
Always IncludeÂ  |  Persists the association when the associated document is revised, ensuring that the tag is always associated with the current version. If this is not set the tag will only be associated with the version that was current when the association was made.   
Tag Managers can change this setting by checking the relevant boxes in this
column. To apply Always Include to all document associations, check the first
box and click on the copy down arrow.

  1. To add one or more new associations, press the Add button, select the documents you want to associate the tag with, add them to the Selected Documents pane and press Add. 
  2. To remove an association, select it and press Remove. If older versions of the document were associated with this tag (the Associated Versions count is greater than 1) then those versions will now be available to view in the Historically Associated Documents pane (see [ Historically Associated Documents ](Historically_Associated_Documents.htm#h) ). 

Note  If the document is deleted, the association will be automatically
affected. If there is only one version of the document, the association will
be shown in gray or, if Permanent Delete is enabled in the workspace, removed.
If there are multiple versions of the document, the association will revert to
the most recent version that was associated with the tag.

  1. To download a document, select it and press Download (see [ Downloading documents ](../Documents/Downloading_documents.htm#h) ). 
  2. To view a document, select it and press View (see [ Viewer (new viewer) ](../Documents/Viewer_\(new_viewer\).htm#h) ). If a hotspot exists for the current tag, it will be automatically displayed when the document is opened. 

Note  If Rendition Security is enabled, all tag management is performed on the
rendition, which is displayed when select View. If you have the Native Users
role, you can select View Native to open the native document in the Viewer,
but tag management cannot be performed in the native document.

  1. To view a documentâs information, select it and press Info (see [ Information ](../Documents/Information.htm#h) ). 
  2. To determine where a document is stored in your workspace, hover over the relevant folder icon to display the folder path. Click on the folder icon to go to that folder.
