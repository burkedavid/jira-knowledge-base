####  Revising documents with placeholders

In non-Business Rules workspaces, if you want the next version of a document
to be a placeholder, use the Revision option in the Register menu.

Note  An existing placeholder should not be revised with another placeholder.Â

Note  Revise is not available in Inbox or Business Rules workspaces. To revise
a document with a placeholder in a Business Rules workspace, create a new
placeholder. FusionLive will automatically revise the existing document with
the placeholder.

  1. In the Documents page, select the folder containing the documents you want to revise. 
  2. Select the required documents. 
  3. Select Revision from the Register menu. 
  4. Amend any metadata values as required.Â 

Note  If the Block Revision setting is enabled, the placeholderâs new
revision number must be higher than previous versions.Â

  1. If the document being revised had attachments you can carry them forward as attachments to the placeholder. To do this, check the Carry Forward All Attachments box. The attachments are listed. Note You cannot select individual attachments to carry forward. 
  2. In a Deliverables Management workspace where a schedule has been created for the document, the next Reason For Issue in the schedule will be displayed and the relevant submission and issue dates will automatically be applied.Â 

However, if the document is in a PM status that prevents change of reason for
issue, the Reason For Issue of the document will be carried forward to the
placeholder.

Note  Document Controllers can select a different reason for issue (however,
changing to any but the next reason for issue in the schedule will be to
deviate from the schedule).

  1. To revise the documents with placeholders press Upload.Â
