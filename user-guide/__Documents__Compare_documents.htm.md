####  Compare documents

The Viewer allows you to compare two versions of a document. The following
file formats can be compared.

Type  |  Description   
---|---  
PLT  |  HP plot file   
DWF  |  AutoCAD Web Format   
DWG  |  AutoCAD drawing   
DGN  |  MicroStation file   
PDF  |  Adobe Acrobat PDF   
  
Â Â Â  
Note  If Rendition Security is enabled, the renditions of the selected
documents will be compared, not the natives themselves.

  1. In the folder that contains the document that you want to compare, double click on the document to open its document page.Â 
  2. In the Version History area, select two document versions that you want to compare. 
  3. Select Compare Versions. The viewer will open in a pop-up window, containing both of the documents (or their renditions) presented side by side.

Comparison view  |  Description   
---|---  
Overlay  |  Overlays both versions on top of each other. Use the slider to change the transparency of each file - right to display the right version and dim the left version, left to display the left version and dim the right version. Overlay works best if a background color is explicitly selected.   
Overlay Differences  |  With this button, the left file version opens overlaid on the right file. The left file displays in cyan, and the right file displays in red. Geometry/text that has not changed (common between both revisions) is gray when the slider is centered. Use slider to change transparency for clearer visibility of the file differences - right or left to dim each document.   
Side-by-Side  |  Both versions are displayed in a split-screen view. Click Right or Left to select the active document for which to apply file functions. Markup entities can be created on either the active or inactive document panel.   
Left  |  Only the file that was first selected is displayed on the left pane.   
Right  |  Only the file that was selected second is displayed on the right pane.
