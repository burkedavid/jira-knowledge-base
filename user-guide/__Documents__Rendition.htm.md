###  Rendition

When the Renditions module is enabled, users with Rendition roles (see [ Role
memberships ](../Admin/User_Settings/Role_membership.htm#h) ) can manually
create, download and delete renditions for selected native documents. A
rendition is a copy of the native document in a different file format. The
format of the rendition is determined by the Rendition Template with which it
is associated (see [ Renditions Administration
](../Admin/Renditions_Admin/Renditions_Administration.htm#h) ).

Renditions can also be created automatically when a document is uploaded (if
Auto Rendition is enabled) or as a result of its involvement with an Approval
or Formal Review activity.

The following file types can be sent for rendition.
