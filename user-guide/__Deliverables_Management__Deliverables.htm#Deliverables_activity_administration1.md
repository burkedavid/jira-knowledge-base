##  Deliverables Activities

The key activities performed within Deliverables Management are:

  * [ Submittals ](../Activities/Submittals.htm#h) â used by external parties to send packages of deliverables documents. Once the receipt of the submitted documents is acknowledged, document controllers can then either directly respond to the external party or forward the submitted documents for formal review and formal approval. The entire process is tracked against return dates to ensure you respond to the external party in time. If a resubmission is required, resubmission dates for the external party are automatically calculated. 
  * [ Formal Reviews ](../Activities/New_Topic3.htm#h) â allows reviewers to comment on a document, either directly with an electronic comment or by applying a private markup comment using the Viewer. The lead reviewer then consolidates both electronic comments and mark-ups and applies a final decision code before closing the review. 
  * [ Formal Approvals ](../Activities/Formal_Approvals.htm#h) â allows an approver to determine whether submitted documents are accepted or rejected. 
  * [ Issue transmittals ](../Activities/Issue_transmitta.htm#h) â allows you to issue documents either to a wider audience within the company or to deliver them to the client. 

Each of these activities results in a change of lifecycle status for the
document.

###  Deliverables activity administration

Deliverables Activity administrators can oversee all submittals, formal
reviews and formal approvals processed in a deliverables workspace. This
allows them to view all of the submittals in the workspace, acknowledge
unacquired submittals or reassign acquired ones to different users, as well as
oversee all of the reviews and approvals.

To add and remove users to the Deliverables Activity Administration Role see [
Role memberships ](../Admin/User_Settings/Role_membership.htm#h) .
