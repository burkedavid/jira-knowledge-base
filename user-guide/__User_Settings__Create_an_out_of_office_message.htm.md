####  Create an Out of Office message√Ç

If you are going to be absent from your projects for a period of time, you can
set an Out of Office message. When other users try to send you a message or
add you an activity, your name will be shown in red. If they proceed to
include you in the activity, they will receive an email containing your Out of
Office message.

You can designate a user to receive messages and activities on your behalf for
each of the workspaces you are assigned to.

  1. To turn on Out of Office, check the Out Of Office Checkbox. 
  2. Enter your message in the Out Of Office Message textbox. 
  3. To assign a designated user to receive your activities in your absence, click the Designated user link. 
  4. Select the required workspace from the drop-down menu and press the Add button, or press Add All to select all of your workspaces. 
  5. For each workspace, select the user to receive your activities. 
  6. Press the Apply button.
