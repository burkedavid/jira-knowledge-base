##  Distribution matrix

If you are an Automatic Distribution Administrator, FusionLive allows you
manage the automatic distribution of uploaded documents to nominated
recipients in specified companies or via print shops and to initiate certain
activities, such as Approvals or Formal Reviews (see [ Distribution
](../Documents/New_Topic8.htm) ). The rules by which documents are distributed
are determined within a Distribution Matrix.

The distribution matrix allows you to specify what happens when certain
combinations of values are provided for document category fields. For each
combination of values, the matrix allows you to determine, for a range of
specified recipients, how many print copies will be distributed, what type of
activities are initiated at the same time and the reason for issue.

Note  If Workspace Level Upload is enabled, one distribution matrix is used by
all Automatic Distribution Administrators in the workspace. If that feature is
not enabled, each Automatic Distribution Manager can upload and operate their
own distribution matrix.

Before you start configuring a distribution matrix, make sure that the
following workspace elements are set up:

Workspace elements  |  Description   
---|---  
Document Categories and fieldsÂ Â Â Â Â Â  |  Make sure that the document categories exist and are active, and make sure that the system and custom fields that you will use to determine distribution exist, are active and can accept the values that will be provided (for example, that a drop-drop menu field contains all of the required options).   
See [ Category admin ](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Category_adm.htm) for more
information.  
Distribution CodesÂ Â Â  |  Make sure that the distribution codes for this workspace contain the codes for the distribution actions and reasons for issue that you will use in this matrix. Distribution actions can initiate FusionLive activities (for example, messages or formal reviews) using the distributed documents.Â   
See [ Manage distribution codes ](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Manage_d.htm)
for more information.  
Print Shops and recipientsÂ Â  |  If you intend to distribute physical copies, make sure that the print shops that will receive the distribution requests are set up for this workspace.   
See [ Workspace companies ](../Admin/User_Settings/Workspace_c.htm) for more
information.
