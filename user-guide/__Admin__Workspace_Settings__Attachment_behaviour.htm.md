####  Attachment behavior

Note  Available in workspaces without Business Rules only.

You can configure the way that document attachments behave when they are
uploaded. An attachment can either inherit its reference number from its
parent document or it can be given its own.

If the inherit option is selected, the upload process automatically recognizes
specific file types as attachments.
