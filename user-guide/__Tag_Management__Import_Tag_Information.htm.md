##  Import Tag Information

You can import tag information that has been exported from an external system
into the tag register. This allows you to process many tag records, as well as
define document and purchase order associations, in one operation. In addition
to creating new tags, you can use the import feature to edit tag metadata and
associations and append new associations for existing tags. You can also
supersede an existing tag and replace it with another existing tag.
