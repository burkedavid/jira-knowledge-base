###  Extraction Configuration Site

A tag extraction configuration is a set of rules that determine how
information in Idox DIW is extracted to create tag records in FusionLive. The
Extraction Configuration page allows you to select the tag extraction
configuration that will be used when tag extraction is requested.

  1. In the Tag Settings pane of the Administration page, select Extraction Configuration Site. 
  2. To select a configuration for use with the workspace, select from the Active Configuration drop-down list. 

The details of the selected configuration are displayed.

####  Manage Extraction Configurations

Extraction configurations are managed by Tag Managers in an external Tag
Configuration site (see [ Tag extraction configuration
](../../Tag_Management/Tag_extraction_configuration.htm#h) ).
