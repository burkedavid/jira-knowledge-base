#####  Create data feed

You can create a link that can be used to allow external parties to access
Table reports. Note Ã‚ Feed link shortcuts can only be generated for Table
reports. The feeds do not include security, so you must secure the files that
contain them. Also, the feeds will expire after the number of days that is
defined in the Workspace Settings when the feed is created (see [ Workspace
Details ](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Workspace_Deta.htm#h) ).

  1. In the BI Reports tab, select the report you want to create a feed for. 
  2. Click on the ... icon to the left of the report name and select Feed. 
  3. In the Feed URL pop-up window, right click on the URL string and copy the shortcut. 
  4. To send the feed link to another user, paste the link into an email or message. 
  5. Press Close to close the Feed URL pop-up window.
