###  Reopen Formal Review

Once a formal review has been closed, if you spot any mistakes you can reopen
it to allow the lead reviewer to rectify them. Changes which can be made in a
reopened review include changing the decision code, changing the comments,
markups or consolidated layer selected for publication, and republishing the
review summary PDF or Excel spreadsheet.

Reopening the formal review does not allow you to perform the whole review
again. The only change made to the review dates or participants is Actual
Review Date, which is cleared and will only be populated when the review is
closed again.

When a Formal Review is reopened, the PM status of the review documents will
be reverted. The new status will either be the Creation PM Status specified by
the review type or, if no Creation PM Status is specified, the last status the
documents had before the review was closed.

Note  If the review document has a rendition, when the review is reopened the
rendition will revert to the version it had before the review was closed.Â

Note  If your workspace now uses the new viewer but the formal review was
initiated before the switchover and then closed, it is necessary to open the
review documents in the new viewer before reopening the formal review..
