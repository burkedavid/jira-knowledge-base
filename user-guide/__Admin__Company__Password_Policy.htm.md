###  Password Policy

The Password Policy page allows you to configure the policy for setting
FusionLive login passwords for your company. This will include a password
expiration period. When a user nears the end of their expiration period they
will be prompted to reset their password.Â

Wrong password warningÂ  |  When a user enters an incorrect password, a warning can be displayed indicating the number of log in attempts they have left.
