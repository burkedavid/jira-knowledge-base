##  Copy Documents

You can use your FusionLive briefcase to copy documents from one workspace to
another.

Note  You cannot select multiple documents from multiple workspaces or copy
documents within a sub-project.

Note  This functionality is not available if either of the workspaces is a
Business Rules workspace.

Note  If you are a member of the Restricted Users role for either workspace
and the documents you are copying have attachments whose file type is not on
the Unrestricted Attachments list, you will not be able to copy those
attachments.

  1. In the Documents page, add the documents that you want to copy to your Briefcase (see [ Adding Documents to the Briefcase ](../Documents/Adding_Documents_to_the_Briefcase.htm#h) ). 
  2. In the menu bar, select the workspace that you want to copy the documents to. 
  3. Click on the Briefcase icon to access the briefcase. Your briefcase documents are arranged by workspace. 
  4. Select the documents that you want to copy and then press Copy Document. 
  5. In the Files page of the pop-up window, supply the Category and Reference for each document, then press Next. 
  6. In the Metadata page, select the folders the copied documents should be stored in and supply all relevant metadata.Ã‚ 

Note  In a Deliverables Management workspace, the Originator field is
automatically filled with the name of your company. If the Allow Edit by
Multiple Originators feature is not enabled, Originator cannot be changed
except by a Document Controller or Workspace Administrator.

  1. Press Done to copy the selected documents.
