###  Copy a transmittal

Instead of creating a new transmittal from scratch you can make a copy of an
existing one. This feature can save time if, for example, you send out a
regular transmittal to the same group of recipients (for example, minutes of a
weekly meeting).

Note  Issue transmittals cannot be copied.

  1. To make a copy of a transmittal, navigate to the Transmittals folder containing the transmittal you want to copy. 
  2. Tick the check box to select the transmittal you want to copy, then press the Copy button. 
  3. Review the transmittal details, recipients and attached documents and make any changes necessary for the new transmittal. 
  4. To distribute the transmittal to the recipients, press the Send button.
