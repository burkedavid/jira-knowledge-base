####  Email Signature

You can create a signature that will be automatically included in your
FusionLive messages. Signatures typically contain a userâs name, company,
job title and contact details, but you can add any information you think will
be useful.Â

  1. In the Email Signature box, type the information that you want to include. 
  2. Use the FusionLive text editor to style the basic information (see [ Text editor options ](../Overview/Text_editor_options.htm) ). 
  3. To automatically include the signature in your messages, check the Include my signature box.Â 

You can uncheck this again if you want to stop applying your signature
automatically. You will still be able to include the signature manually when
creating the message.

  1. Press the Apply button.
