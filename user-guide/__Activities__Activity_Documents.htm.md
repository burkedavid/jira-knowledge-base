###  Activity Documents

Activities often include document attachments for you to perform an action on
(for example, approvals) or to provide information (for example, technical
queries).  Note  If you are a member of the Restricted Users role for this
workspace and you receive an activity with an attachment whose file type is
not on the Unrestricted Attachments list, you will not be able to download,
view or add that attachment to your briefcase.You will also not be able to
send that attachment on another activity.

If the attached document has been filed in the workspace folder structure you
can view its location by clicking on the Folder path link.

Note  If Rendition Security is enabled, only users with the Native User role
can view or download native documents. Users without this role can only view
renditions.Â
