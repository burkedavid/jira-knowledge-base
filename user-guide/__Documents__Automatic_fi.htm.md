####  Automatic distribution

Automatic Distribution distributes documents according to their metadata as
determined by the distribution matrix. If the metadata does not match any
valid combination of values set out in the distribution matrix, the documents
will not be distributed.

  1. Open the Documents page and check the box to select one or more documents. 
  2. From the Activities menu, expand Distribution and select Automatic. 
  3. The distribution matrix contains the names of the standard recipients that the document will be distributed to, however you can add additional users at this time. 
  4. Press Save. Alternatively, press Save and Quit to close the page for now. You can return to it later via the Automatic Distribution Manager. 
  5. Press Submit.
