###  Project templates

Project templates are used as the basis for creating sub-projects. Sub-
projects allow you to create a special area in your document folder structure
in which a controlled set of users can work with the documents and perform
project tasks.Ã‚

Project templates involve:

  * Attributes - the metadata fields associated with the sub-project 
  * Roles - the workspace roles which define which users can use the sub-project 
  * Folders - the document folder within your folder structure within which the sub-project folder will be created 
  * Tasks - tasks associated with the sub-project 
  * Synchronization - synchronizes the template with the folders to which it is applied
