###  Filter criteria

Once you have run a report, you can refine the results by selecting different
options from the filter criteria associated with the report.Â

As a minimum, these will include the time period over which data is considered
relevant to the report, but there may also be other filtering options.

  1. The time period relevant to the report is defined as being on, before, after, between or excluding certain dates. You can change the time period dates by specifying either fixed dates and times or a relative period.Â 
  2. To specify a fixed date and time, type it into the relevant criteria field. For Standard BI Reports, the date format is: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm (for example: 01/03/2015 01:00). For custom BI reports, contact the report designer. 
  3. Alternatively, click on the calendar icon to the right of the field and select the date and time using the date picker. You can press Now to choose the current date and time.

Press Apply to enter your selection.

  1. Relative time periods allow you to specify a time before or after now. You can specify periods relative to the current day, week, month, quarter, semi (half year) or year.Â 

In the relevant criteria field, enter the required time unit, in capital
letters. Follow this with - and an integer to specify a period in the past.
Alternatively, + and an integer to specify a period in the future.Â

For example: MONTH-3 specifies three months ago, WEEK+1 specifies next week,
DAY (without any modifier) specifies today.

  1. In addition to time-based criteria, you may be able to select other field data to filter the report by (for example, company name, user name or document action). Click on the list icon to the right of the field you want to use to filter.

When you have finished selecting values, press Close.

  1. To regenerate the report with your new filter criteria, press Apply.
