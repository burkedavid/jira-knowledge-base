###  Add a markup to a document on a formal review

As a commenter you can also add annotations and change marks as markups to a
document using the FusionLive Viewer. During a formal review, privacy settings
ensure that markups can only be viewed by members of the review. If the review
is internal to one company, all members of the review can see the review
markups. If the review participants are from different companies, the markups
are hidden from the initiator.Ã‚

The lead reviewer and consolidator may decide which, if any, markups will be
published for public view.

  1. Select the document you want to add markups to and press View. 
  2. You can review other markups and add your own using the Viewer tools (see [ Create markups ](../Documents/Create_markup_\(new_viewer\).htm#h) ).  Note  You cannot edit markups created by another user. You can however save existing markups as a new layer of your own and edit them there. 
  3. When you are finished, save your markup and close the Viewer window.
