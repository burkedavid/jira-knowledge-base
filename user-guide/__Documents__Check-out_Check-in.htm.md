###  Check-Out/Check-In

When you want to update a FusionLive document, checking the document out locks
it, downloads it and allows you to open it for updating. When you have
finished your updates, checking the document in prompts you to upload a new
version and unlocks the document.Â

Note  The filename of a checked out document is determined by your preferred
download naming convention. By default this is the fileâs reference, but it
can be changed while downloading documents. Using the reference makes the
upload/check-in process easier.

Note  Check-out and check-in are not available in Inbox workspaces or
workspaces with Business Rules.Â

Note  If Rendition Security is enabled, only users with the Native User role
can check out the native document. Check-out and Check-in are unavailable to
users without this role.
