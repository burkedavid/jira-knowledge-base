###  Creating A New Folder

In order to create a new folder:

  * If the Folder Management setting is enabled, you must be a member of the Folder Administrators role 
  * You must also be a workspace administrator to create folders at the root level 
  * You must also be a super administrator or assigned as an administrator or contributor for a secure folder to create folders within it. 

Once created, a public folder cannot be made secure, and a secure folder
cannot be made public.

####  Creating a public folder

A folder that is public from the top level down can be viewed by any user of
that workspace.Â

Note  If you create a public folder within a secure folder, it will
automatically inherit the permissions of the parent folder.

  1. In the Documents page, select the folder in which you want to create a new folder. 
  2. Press the Create Folder button in the navigation pane. 
  3. Enter the name of the folder in the text box. 
  4. Press Create, then refresh the page. (New folders appear at the bottom of the folder hierarchy until the list is refreshed.) 

####  Creating a secure folder

A secure folder can only be viewed by users who have been nominated to be
administrators, contributors and viewers for that specific folder.

  1. In the Documents page, select the folder in which you want to create a new folder. 
  2. Press the Create Folder button in the navigation pane. 
  3. Enter the name of the folder in the text box. 
  4. Check the Secure Folder checkbox. 
  5. If the parent folder is also a secure folder, to copy the permissions from the parent folder, check the Inherit Rights From Parent Folder checkbox. 

Note Â  This inheritance only happens upon creation. The new folder does not
continue to inherit changes from the parent. There is a relationship where if
you remove a user from the parent level, it is removed from the child, but if
you add a user at the parent level, it is available to add manually by
administering the access rights of the child, but it is not added
automatically. To add a user to an existing folder structure where all folders
are secure, you must add the user to the top and then to each child.

To create an ongoing inheritance where you only need to make security changes
at the top level, create a public folder instead.

  1. To manually assign users to specific roles, select them in the Workspace Users list and press the appropriate Add box to assign them to the Administrator Users, Contributor Users or Viewer Users lists.Â 

If the Workspace Users list is large, you can filter it by User, Group or All
Users. You can also search for a user by entering their name and company into
the textboxes above the Workspace User list.

You can remove users from a role by pressing the Remove button in under that
category.

  1. When you have added all the users to each of the roles, press Create, then refresh the page. (New folders appear at the bottom of the folder hierarchy until the list is refreshed.)
