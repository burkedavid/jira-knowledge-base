###  Login details

If a user forgets their login credentials, they can reset their password by
clicking on the Forgotten Login Details link on the login page (see [
Forgotten passwordÂ ](../User_Settings/Forgotten.htm#h) ).Â

If required, you can also send a reminder notification of their username or a
link that allows them to reset their password.  Note  This only applies to

your IT department.
