###  Manage Reassigns

Role and activity reassignment provides an easy method of transferring
FusionLive activities and permissions from one user to another. Both users
must be active in one or more workspaces, and the source user must be active
in the current workspace.

At the end of the process you can choose to automatically deactivate that
account from the workspace or bar the account entirely from FusionLive.

####  Create reassignment request

  1. In the Self Administration pane, select Manage Reassigns. 
  2. Enter the name of the user in the current workspace who you want to reassign activities and permissions From. 
  3. Enter the name of a user, either in this workspace or in your extended network, that you want to assign the activities and permissions To. Press Search. 

Note  This field does not fill automatically because it is searching outside
of the workspace.

Note  Your extended network includes users who are members of your company or
members of companies who share a workspace with your company.

  1. Choose one or more Workspaces associated with the activities and permissions you want to reassign. 
  2. In the Activities and Permissions list, tick the items that you want to reassign. 
  3. Press Next. 
  4. Review the list of activities and permissions that are going to be reassigned between the nominated users. Press Back to go back and make alterations if necessary. 
  5. To temporarily limit access to the workspace for the user, select Deactivate from workspace. To remove access to FusionLive for the user, select Barred from system. 
  6. Press Confirm. 

The reassignment request will be scheduled to run automatically overnight when
FusionLive is not in regular use.
