###  Milestone chains

The Deliverables Management module allows you to track the progress of
documents. In the course of its operating life a version of the same document
may need to enter the deliverables workflow several times, for different
reasons. At the end of the workflow, the documents are issued and
FusionLiveâs milestone chains relate the reasons for issue to percentage
completion. Milestone chains can be created for specific document types or be
used to apply to all non-specified types of document.

For example, you may wish to use three milestones in a chain, each related to
a different pass through the deliverables workflow. When a specified type of
document is issued with one of these reasons for issue, the Percentage
Complete field records how far the document has reached in its overall life.

Reason for IssueÂ  |  Percentage complete   
---|---  
Issue for Review  |  15%   
Issue for ApprovalÂ  |  50%   
Issue for Construction  |  100%   
  
Â

Additionally, lifecycle status can be used to automatically update the
percentage complete. This allows document completion stages to be realized
without having to issue the document. By enabling this feature on selected
statuses, the percentage complete is updated according to the milestone chain
when a document is given such a status, either during the course of the
deliverables workflow, as a result of another process (for example, upload,
revision or placeholder creation), or when the lifecycle status is changed
manually (see [ Create PM status ](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Create_P.htm#h)
).
