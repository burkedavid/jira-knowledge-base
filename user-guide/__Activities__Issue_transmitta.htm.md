###  Issue transmittals

Note  Available in Deliverables Management workspaces only.

The final stage in the deliverables workflow for a document that has been
submitted by an external party, reviewed and approved is for it to be issued
to the client or a wider audience. This can be done formally by sending the
document using an Issue Transmittal. When the transmittal is sent, the
documentâs lifecycle is changed to Issued, the Issue Date is populated and
the appropriate milestone completion percentage for the document type and
reason for issue is applied. Any document comments and the external partyâs
Client Reference Number are included in the transmittal.

If the Issued status is configured to trigger automatic distribution (see [
Create PM status ](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Create_P.htm#h) ), the actions
defined in the distribution matrix will be initiated automatically.Â

Note  If you plan to use issue transmittals in your workflow, the document
category type must be the Deliverables category type or Deliverables and
Externally Supplied category type.
