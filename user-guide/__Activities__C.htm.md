can optionally make an electronic comment.

  2. To view each document click on its Review link. In the Review details page, you can view the document in its native format by selecting it and pressing Download. Alternatively, you can view it in FusionLive Viewer by selecting it and pressing View. 
  3. To add a comment, select the document and press the Comment button.Â 

To add comments to several formal reviews at once, select them in the For My
Comment folder and press the Comment button.

Depending on the modules enabled for your workspace, these may be sourced either from the workspace folder structure or from your local system. Attachments sourced from workspace files are known as controlled documents and will be available to be viewed by other users in the workspace. You can also create new controlled attachments by uploading them when the comment is made. However, if the documents are temporary and are not required to be added to the workspace they can be attached as uncontrolled documents instead.
