####  Send an Issue Transmittal

As part of the submittals workflow, the submittal documents may be required,
after possible review and approval, to be sent to the client or another
external party. This is done with an Issue Transmittal, and is often done once
the submittal has been responded to.Ã‚

However, you can send issue transmittals from within an ongoing submittal.
Doing this allows you obtain comments from the client which can then be fed
back into the document review process (see [ Revise a reviewed document with
comments ](Revise.htm#h) ).

  1. Open the submittal containing the documents you want to send by issue transmittal. 
  2. Select the documents. 
  3. Click on Activities and select Issue Transmittal. Complete the transmittal details and press Send (see [ Issue transmittals ](Issue_transmitta.htm#h) ).
