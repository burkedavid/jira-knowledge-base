####  Reassign RFI

If another user should answer a request instead of you, you can reassign the

list.

  2. From the Select Project drop-down menu, choose the appropriate sub-project. 
  3. Click on the Assigned To link and, in the Select Users window, add the person you want to reassign the request to. 
  4. In the Select Users window, select users to add For Comment and For Information. Note that this will not remove the users originally assigned For Comment and For Information. 
  5. Press Apply. 
  6. In the Comment area, tell the user why youâre sending the RFI to them. 
  7. Press Send.
