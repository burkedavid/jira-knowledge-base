###  Technical query actions

There are a number of ways to respond to a technical query. The action you
perform will usually be dictated by the reason it was sent to you. That is, if
a request appears in your Assigned To Me folder, you are expected to provide
an answer. If it appears in your For My Comment folder, you maybe expected to
comment on the document.Â

In addition to providing answers and comments, there are other actions
available which enable you to ensure that the query process is carried out by
the users most equipped to do so.

The actions available when you select a technical query include:Â

  * [ Provide Answer ](TQ_Provide_answer.htm#h) \- allows you to provide the requested information 
  * [ Mark As Read ](TQ_mark_as_read.htm#h) \- allows you to select multiple queries and remove their unread status without opening each one individually 
  * [ Forward technical query ](Forward_TQ.htm#h) \- allows you to forward the query to additional users who you think should be involved in the approval processÂ 
  * [ Reassign technical query ](reassign.htm#h) \- allows you to send the query to users who you think are better equipped than yourself to respond to it.Â Reassigning a technical query removes it from your activities list 
  * [ Reopen technical query ](Reopen.htm#h) \- allows you to open a closed query 
  * [ Edit Answer ](Edit_answer_T.htm#h) \- allows you to change a previously submitted answer in a reopened query 
  * [ Comment on technical query ](Comment_on_TQ.htm#h) \- allows you to comment on a technical query 

####  Technical query alerts

Whenever you perform an action on a technical query (such as providing an
answer, making a comment or reassigning the query to other recipients), you
are given the option to notify some or all of the people who are involved in
the query (for example, the creator, the assignee and any recipients the query
was sent to for comment).Â
