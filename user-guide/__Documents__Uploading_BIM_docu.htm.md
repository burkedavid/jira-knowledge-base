####  Uploading BIM documents

When you upload a new .IFC document to FusionLive, revise an existing one, add
it as an attachment or add it as content to a placeholder, the new document is
automatically synchronized to the external BIM application. You will be
notified by email when the synchronization has been successful or given
details of why it failed.

The synchronization status of an .IFC file is displayed next to it.

Icon  |  Description   
---|---  
![](../images/sync-completed.png) |  Synchronized   
![](../images/sync-pending.png) |  Synchronization in progress   
![](../images/sync-failed.png) |  Synchronization failedÂ   
Note  If the synchronization fails you will be notified by email.  
  
  

Note  Due to there being an upload file size limit of 750MB, .IFC files are
first compressed to IFCZIP format. Therefore, it is recommended that .IFC
files be less than 2GB in size in order to be uploaded.Â

When you upload or create a new document in the external BIM application, in
order to enable the synchronization to match the filename to the reference in
FusionLive, allowing you to revise existing FusionLive documents and add
content to placeholders, copy the filename into the Comments field.  Note  The
external application comments field has a limit of 400 characters. Â Â

.IFC files can also be used in an activity or activity workflow. When a user
receives an activity containing a .IFC file they can view it using the
FusionLive viewer or the external BIM viewer.Â

The same is true when an .IFC is returned in search results.
