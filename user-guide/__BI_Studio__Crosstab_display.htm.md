Crosstab reports show interrelated data in a pivot table format.Ã‚

The only configuration you can make to the presentation of a crosstab is to
order the data.

  1. Select the column that you want to use to order the crosstab. 
  2. To sort the table in standard numerical and alphabetical order, click on the Sort ascending arrow icon. 
  3. To sort the table in reverse numerical and alphabetical order, click on the Sort descending arrow icon. 
  4. You can add further layers of organization by sorting by additional columns. This is useful when the first sort column may have several similar entries. For example, in a report sorted primarily by document title, it may be useful to introduce a secondary sort ordered by version number. 
  5. The order of a column used for sorting is indicated by an up or down arrow in the column header. To stop sorting by this column, click on the Sort button that matches the icon.
