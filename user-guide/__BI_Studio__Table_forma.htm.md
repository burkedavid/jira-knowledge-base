####  Table format

The Table report format allows you to display selected field metadata in the
form of a table. Each column represents a metadata field and each row
represents one document, user, distribution or activity (whichever is the
subject of the report). Rows can be grouped by additional fields (for example,
a document report organized by the users who processed the documents).
