####  Initiate a Formal Approval

As part of the submittals workflow, submittal documents can be allocated to a
pool of users to be approved.

Note  Documents cannot be sent for approval if they have been set to the
Approved or Rejected status, or once they have been responded to.

  1. Open the submittal containing the documents you want to send for approval. 
  2. Select the documents from the Not Responded area. 
  3. Click on Activities and select Formal Approval. Complete the approval details and press Send (see [ Formal Approvals ](Formal_Approvals.htm#h) for more information).
