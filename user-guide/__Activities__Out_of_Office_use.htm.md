###  Out of Office users

If a user has set their profile to Out of Office, their name will be shown in
red when you are selecting activity recipients. If you proceed to add that
user to the activity you will receive an out of office email. If the user has
designated another user to receive activities in their absence, that user will
automatically receive the activity instead of the selected recipient.
