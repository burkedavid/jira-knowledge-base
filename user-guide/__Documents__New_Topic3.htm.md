####  Markup Security

When the Deliverables Management module is enabled, comments and markups made
to documents under review are considered private. The Viewer can be used to
add markups to documents under review and by the lead reviewer to consolidate
the markups that will be publicly published when the review is closed. The
banner at the top of the Viewer screen indicates whether privacy is applied.

Additionally, the markup tools available when you open a document in the
Viewer will depend on whether you are involved in a formal review and whether
Viewer is opened from inside or outside of a formal review.Â
