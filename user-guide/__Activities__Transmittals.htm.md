##  Transmittals

Transmittals are workflow processes that record in FusionLive how documents
and instructions are sent to other users with the intention of one or more
actions to be performed by the recipients. In some cases the documents and
instructions are distributed using the transmittal itself. In other
circumstances they may be delivered by email or by printed hard copy.
FusionLive transmittals record all of these eventualities.

There are two kinds of transmittal:

  * Standard transmittal â used to send documents to internal and external contacts 
  * Issue transmittal â used to issue documents to a client or a wider audience (Deliverables Management workspaces only) 

The Transmittals activity area is structured into the following folders:

  * Received - transmittals that have been sent to you or to your company 
  * Sent - transmittals that you or your company have sent to other people 
  * All Workspace Transmittals - if you are a Transmittals administrator, you can view all of the transmittals that have been sent or received in this workspace. However, you can only acknowledge receipt of transmittals sent to your company.Â
