###  Deliverables Reports

You can create custom Business Intelligence reports to display deliverables
data. See [ Standard BI Reports ](../BI_Studio/BI_Report_Typ.htm#h) and [
Create BI Report ](../BI_Studio/Create_BI_report.htm#h) more information.

Note  Revisions resulting from documents being revised with comments during a
deliverables lifecycle result in multiple instances of the same document being
reported. Revised with comments revisions are automatically filtered out in
the standard deliverables reports. When creating custom reports, you can
select No to display revise with comments revisions or Yes to filter them out.
Alternatively, selecting Null from this filter allows you to display only the
revisions of a document that have not been sent on submittal.
