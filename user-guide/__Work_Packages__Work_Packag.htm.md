#  Work Packages

FusionLive Work Packages enable you to collate documents stored in a workspace
folder (and optionally subfolders) into a single package. This allows project
documents to be distributed and printed together in a more controlled way, and
additionally allows you to monitor additions, removals and revisions to the
contents of the folder via the package coversheetâs change box and by
running a work package report.

Note  Work Packages are not available in Inbox workspaces or workspaces with
Business Rules.Â
