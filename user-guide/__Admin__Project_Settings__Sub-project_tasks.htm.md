#####  Sub-project tasks

One of the key features of sub-projects is the provision of workflow tasks
that enable the sub-project users to perform project-specific functions on
documents. Tasks are assigned to workflow roles and can be initiated in a
sequence whereby later tasks cannot start until the tasks that they depend on
are completed. The first tasks in the sequence start when a document is
uploaded into the sub-project.

The steps required in creating a task are compartmentalized into panes which
can be expanded or hidden as required:

  * Details - the operational details of the task, including duration, priority and the assigned role 
  * Dependencies - which tasks must be completed before this task can start 
  * Instructions - instructions to the recipient 
  * Folders - nominated reference and working folders and links to internal or external web pages of related material 
  * Alerts - configure alerts when a task is started or completed 

Â

  1. To create a task, press Add Task. 
  2. Enter the name of the task in the Task Name box. 
  3. Provide a unique system code in the Code box. 
  4. Enter the number of days that the task should take in the Estimated Duration box. 
  5. Select the task priority from the Priority drop-down menu. 
  6. Select the workflow role assigned to carry out this task from the Assign to Project Role drop-down menu. 
  7. Tasks can have an associated phase. Select from the Phase drop-down menu or type a new phase in the box below. 
  8. If you want users who receive this task to be able to reassign it to another user, check the Assignee can reassign task box. 
  9. When a user completes a task, a completion date must be provided. By default this is the date when the task is completed. If you want the user to be able to select the completion date, check the Confirm completion date when user closes task box. 
  10. Expand the Task Dependencies pane. 
  11. In the Available Tasks box, select the tasks that must be completed before the current task can start. Press the right-arrow button to move them to the Selected Task Dependencies box. To remove a dependent task, select it and press the left-arrow button. 

Note  It is good practice to create your tasks in the order in which they will
be executed so that, while the first task will have no dependencies, if the
second depends on the completion of the first that dependency can be recorded
when the second task is created. You can always edit your tasks and clarify
the dependencies later as well.

  1. Expand the Instructions pane. 
  2. Type the task instructions into the box. You can format the instruction text using the text editor options (see [ Text editor options ](../../Overview/Text_editor_options.htm#h) ). 
  3. The folders panes allow you to define the document areas that this task will apply to.Â 

Click on the Reference Folder link to define the parts of the non-project-
specific folder structure that users of this task will need reference to. You
can add multiple reference folder locations and they can be either from the
template folder structure or the general workspace folder structure.

Select the appropriate tab, navigate to the folder you want to include and
press the Add button. When you have finished adding folders to your reference
folders, press Done.

  1. Click on the Working Folder link to define the template folder that will be the working folder for this task. Navigate to the folder you want and press the Set Working Folder button, then press Done. 
  2. You can add URL links to internal or external web pages containing useful relevant information. Enter the URL in the box and press Add to add it to the list. You can remove an unwanted link from the list by selecting it and pressing Remove. 
  3. You can send alert notifications to users assigned to selected roles when this task is activated and when it is completed.Â 

To send an alert on activation or completion, check the appropriate box and
enter the Activation Message or Completion Message, as required.

  1. If you chose to send a notification, click on the Alert Recipients links. In the Available Roles box, select the project roles whose users you want to receive the alert messages. Click the right arrow to move them to the Selected Roles box. Press Save when you are finished. 
  2. When you have completed all the sections of your task, press the Save button at the top of the page. Note You may need to scroll up to locate the Save button.
