##  Run BI Report

When you run a BI Report, you can define the output filtering settings (for
example, time period), alter the appearance of the report and export the
results.

  1. In the BI Reports tab, select the report that you want to run. 
  2. Click on the Run icon for that report. The report is generated using its default criteria and presented in a table, chart or crosstab format.
