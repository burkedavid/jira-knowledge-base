####  BIM Version History√Ç

If a BIM document contains at least one associated file, a BIM Version History
tab is added to the Document Info page. This tab lists the project files
associated with the BIM document and allows you to perform a variety of
actions.

BIM documents with project files are indicated by a change to their icon. To
download the latest version of a BIM document to your local system, click its
icon.
