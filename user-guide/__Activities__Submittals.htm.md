##  Submittals

Note  Deliverables Management workspaces only.

Suppliers, subcontractors and vendors send packages of deliverables documents
for review and approval. This is done first by adding the documents as content
to placeholders and then combining them into submittal packages.

The submitted documents are acknowledged by the document controller. The
documents may undergo a formal review and possibly a formal approval. When
these are complete, the document controller responds to the submittal. If the
document controller responds with a decision code with the Rejected type or
the Accepted - Provide Content type, the documents need to be revised and
resubmitted. A placeholder can optionally be created ready for the resubmitted
documents.
