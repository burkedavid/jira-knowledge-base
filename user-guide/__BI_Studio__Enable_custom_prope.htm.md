####  Enable custom properties

Document Information, Deliverables Documents and Deliverables Activities
reports allow you to make use not only of all the standard fields but of any
custom property fields that have been added to the document categories (see [
Add custom property field ](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Add_custom_fi.htm#h)
). Additionally, you can incorporate parts from reference numbers (see [ Edit
Reference field ](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Edit_reference_f.htm#h) ). In BI
Reports these fields are made available as Document Fields or Numbering
Fields. If the custom property fields or numbering parts are of Date type then
they are listed under Document Fields (Date) or Numbering Fields (Date).

Once enabled, these fields are used in reports the same way as other fields
and measures.

Note  Deliverables Management fields are accessible by default in reports that
use the Deliverables Management reporting domains. These fields should only be
enabled here if creating reports from non-Deliverables Management domains.
(Since Document Information is the only non-Deliverables Management domain
which allows custom fields, and the Deliverables Documents domain already
shows the same information, there is no reason to ever enable those system
fields here. Enabling them will cause them to show twice on the Deliverables
Management reporting domains.)

The Administration page allows you to choose which of these fields are
available to users of BI Reports.

  1. Open the Administration page and expand Workspace Settings. 
  2. Click on BI Metadata Settings or BI Numbering Settings, as required. These pages list the custom property fields, which category they belong to and whether the data type is text, number or date. In addition, each has a button that allows you to turn them off or on. 
  3. To locate a field, type part of its name into the Field Name box at the top of the page. 
  4. To make a field available in BI Reports, click the button to turn it On. 

To make a field unavailable, turn it Off.
