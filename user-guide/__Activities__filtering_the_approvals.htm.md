###  Filtering the approvals list

To help you find the approval activities of interest quickly, you can filter
the contents of a folder by selecting from the following criteria:

  * Approval Status - the current status of the approval 
  * Sub No. - the unique submittal number which links the approval activities of all associated documentsÂ 
  * Reference or Title - the reference or title of the approval 
  * My Comment - whether you have commented on the approval or it is waiting for your comments. 

Your filtering conditions can be any one of these criteria or a combination of
several.
