####  Mark Delete

You can select and delete print jobs that are in the draft or submitted status
from your reprographics folder.  Note  If the print job is associated with a
transmittal, deleting it does not change the status of the corresponding
transmittal distribution.

  1. Tick the appropriate checkboxes to select one or more print jobs that you want to delete. 
  2. Press the Mark Delete button in the Reprographics menu bar.
