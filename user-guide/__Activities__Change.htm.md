####  Change Priority

FusionLive tasks have an assigned priority. These are identified in a tasks
list by the colored icon:

  * Low priority - green 
  * Normal priority - blue 
  * High priority - red 

If you have the relevant permissions, you can change the priority of a task.

  1. To change the priority of a task, tick the checkbox to select the task whose priority you want to update then press the Change Priority button. 
  2. In the Change Task Priority window, select the new level from the Priority drop-down menu. 
  3. If you want to add a comment, type it in the My Comment box. If you want the comment to be visible in all tasks in the project, tick the checkbox. If you want the comment to be specific to the selected task, leave the checkbox unticked. 
  4. Press the Save button.
