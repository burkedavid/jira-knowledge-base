####  Manage forced alerting

Note  This feature is available only if the Business Rules module and Forced
Alerting setting are enabled.

You can configure which users or groups must be alerted when documents are
uploaded to this category.

Note  If Forced Alerting is enabled once the workspace is already in use, the
notification recipient for any active category will default to the Workspace
Administrator. This can be changed.

  1. Open the Category Admin page, locate a category and select the Manage Forced Alerting users tab. 
  2. To enable a user or group to receive upload alerts, locate them in the Available Users list then press the Add button. 
  3. To remove a user or group, locate them in the Selected Users list then press Remove. 
  4. When you have finished, press Apply.
