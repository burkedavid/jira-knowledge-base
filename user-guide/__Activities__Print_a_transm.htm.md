###  Print a transmittal

There are two methods of printing out a transmittal from your Transmittals
folders.Ã‚

  * Create a Print Job - starts a reprographics print job at an appropriate print facility associated with your project. This allows the print job to be accessed by users at a different location to yourself. 
  * Print a Transmittal - preview and print the transmittal locally. 

  1. In your Transmittals folders, navigate to the location of the transmittal you want to print. 
  2. To print the transmittal via reprographics, press the Create Print Job button (see [ Reprographics ](Reprogra.htm#h) ). 
  3. To print a transmittal locally, press the Print button. Review the contents of the print job, then press Print and follow the instructions for your local printer.
