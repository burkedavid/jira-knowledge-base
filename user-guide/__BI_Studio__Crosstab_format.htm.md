####  Crosstab format

Crosstab type reports allow you to present your data in a tabular format that
allows you to demonstrate the relationships between fields.

#####  Add fields and measures

Crosstab reports allow you to relate nested metadata to a measured value. For
example, the number of approvals submitted to companies and also to users
belonging to those companies. In such a scenario, the fields would be added to
the rows box and the measures added to the columns box.
