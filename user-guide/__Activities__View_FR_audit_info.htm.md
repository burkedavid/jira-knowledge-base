####  View the formal review audit information

The formal review audit information allows you to track the events that happen
to a document on formal review. The audit information details when the formal
review was created, comments were added, individual reviews completed and when
the review was closed. If the review was reopened, the document revised or new
users assigned to the review, this is also listed. The formal review audit
lists the user responsible, date and any changes to lifecycle status and
decision code for each action.

  1. In the review page, select Formal Review Audit from the Formal Review Information drop-down menu.
