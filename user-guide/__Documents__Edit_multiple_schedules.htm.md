#####  Edit multiple schedules offline

Document Controllers and Workspace Administrators can export schedule
information to an Excel spreadsheet, allowing the schedules for multiple
documents to be updated in a single operation. When the spreadsheet is
imported again, the schedules for the relevant documents are automatically
updated.

Note  Only changes to the currently applied reasons for issue and those that
follow in the schedule will be applied at the time of import. Reasons for
issue that a document has already gone through will not be updated.

  1. In the Documents page (or Search results page) select one or more documents or placeholders in a Deliverables, Externally Supplied or Deliverables and Externally Supplied document category. 
  2. From the Document Actions menu, select Schedule, then Export.Â 
  3. An Excel spreadsheet containing the existing schedule information for the selected documents will be downloaded to your computer. Open it.

The references of the selected documents are listed, along with the reasons
for issue and the relevant submission and issue dates according to the
schedules.  Note  The order of the reasons for issue is determined by the
first selected document. If documents have different reasons for issue in
their schedules these will be added to the right.

  1. Add or update the schedule dates as required, then Save the spreadsheet.Â 

Note  Make sure that the dates for each reason for issue in a schedule are
chronologically in order. If there are multiple schedules, the reasons for
issue may not be displayed in left-to-right order.

  1. To import the schedule information, from the Document Actions menu, select Schedule, then Import.Â 
  2. In the Import Schedule window, press the Choose file button, locate the spreadsheet on your computer and press Open.Â 
  3. Press the Import button. The documents will be updated with the new schedule dates.Â 
  4. If there any validation errors, for example, the dates being out of schedule order, the validation screen will indicate which rows of the spread the errors are in. Fix these and import again.
