Note  If Rendition Security is enabled, the renditions of the selected
documents will be compared, not the natives themselves.

  2. In the Version History area, select two document versions that you want to compare. 
  3. Select Compare Versions. The viewer will open in a pop-up window, containing both of the documents (or their renditions).
