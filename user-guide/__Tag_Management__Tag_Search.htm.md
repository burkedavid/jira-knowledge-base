###  Quick search for associations to a tag number

When Tag Management is enabled, the Quick Search box allows you to search for
documents associated with a tag number.  Note  It is possible to use this
search to return documents matching several tag numbers by entering a partial
tag number or using the * wildcard symbol to search for documents associated
with any tag containing the specified criteria, but this is unlikely to be as
useful as specifying a complete, unique tag number.Â

  1. To quick search for documents associated with a tag number, in the drop-down menu to the left of the Quick Search box, select Tag to document associations. 

If you want to perform a standard quick search for documents when Tag
Management is enabled, select Document (see [ Quick Search
](../Search/Quick_Search.htm#h) ).

To search for both documents and document associations, select All.

Note  When Content Search is enabled, the Document option is not available.
You can search for associations or all mentions of the tag number.

  1. Enter the tag number in the Quick Search box and press Enter on your keyboard. 

The search results will list the documents associated with the specified tag
number.Â

###  Advanced search for associations to a tag number

When Tag Management is enabled, a Tag pane is added to the Document Search
page. This allows you to search for documents associated with a tag number,
tag classification, tag type and tag status.Â

  1. Click on Advanced Search, and in the Document Search screen, scroll down to the Tag pane. 
  2. In the Tag Number field, enter a tag number. To search for documents associated with a range of tag numbers, enter part of a number and use the wildcard symbol * (for example, TAG-1* would return documents associated with tags, TAG-1, TAG-10, TAG-100), then press Enter on your keyboard. 
  3. Alternatively, to select specific tags, click on Tag Number. To locate the tags you want, filter the tags list by a combination of Tag Number, Classification, Type, Client Tag Number or Vendor Tag Number and press Go. 

Select one or more tags in the tags list and press Add to move them into the
lower pane.

When you have selected all the tags whose associations you want to search for,
press Done.

  1. To refine the search further, enter the tag Classification or tag Type. 
  2. From the Status drop-down menu, select one or more tag or document association statuses. 
  3. Enter any other document search criteria. 
  4. Press Search. 

The search results will return all of the documents associated with the
supplied tag information.
