#  Business Intelligence Studio

The FusionLive Business Intelligence (BI) StudioÂ Â Â offers a suite of
reporting tools to allow you to measure every business-critical aspect of your
collaborative projects. BI Studio supplements the standard set of FusionLive
reports with an additional range of pre-defined reports which you can filter
as required and view in a variety of table or chart formats. BI Studio also
allows administrators to create custom reports using your own choice of
document data (for example, audit history, distribution or metadata). Reports
can run in real-time or be set up to run on a schedule and be shared with
other users, displayed on user dashboards, exported to designated locations or
distributed by email.Â

BI Studio reports are accessed via the Reports area of your workspace.
