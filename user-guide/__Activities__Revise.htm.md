####  Revise a reviewed document with comments

Note  Non-business rules workspaces only.

When a document has been reviewed outside of the system, you can revise the
document with a new version.

This can be done from within the submittal itself or from the Document Actions
menu in the Documents page. To access this option, the document must either
currently be on a submittal, have been on a formal review, or have been sent
by Issue Transmittal.Â

Note  Documents cannot be revised with comments if they are currently on a
formal review or formal approval.Â

  1. Open the submittal containing the documents you want to revise and select the documents from the Not Responded area. Press the Revise with Comments button. 

Alternatively, select the documents in the Documents page and choose Revise
with Comments from the Document Actions menu.Â

  1. Locate the new versions of the documents and press Open. 
  2. When the Upload Status is Ready, press Next. 
  3. Since you are revising these documents, on the Files page, you cannot change the Category. You may supply an attachment at this stage if required. Press Next. 
  4. On the Metadata page, depending on your category you may be able to change or add some of the metadata. Press Next. 
  5. The final page displays the revised document details, including the decision code and lifecycle status inherited from the previous version. To change the decision code or status for the new version, click in the appropriate fields and select new values. To apply a decision code or status to all documents in a column, select a value for the first document then click on the copy down arrow. 

Note  If a PM status is associated with the selected decision code, the PM
status field will be populated with that code. However, you can select a
different one if required.

  1. Press Update. 
  2. The revised document will be updated in the relevant formal review. If the submittal is open it will also be updated there. 

If Auto Rendition is enabled and the file type of the document is associated
with a rendition template, a rendition will be initiated. Once it has
completed, you will receive a notification and the rendition icon will be
displayed for the document.
