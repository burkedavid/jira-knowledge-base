###  Manage Transmittal Values

By default, transmittals are identified by a unique counter using six digits.
Alternatively, you can configure a custom numbering scheme that uses another
value in addition to the unique counter.Â

For example, say the project represented by this FusionLive workspace is
Sales, and involves three sales regions: Sales North, Sales South and Sales
Central. Your numbering scheme could start with the corresponding values: SN-,
SS- and SC-.

Whenever a user creates a transmittal with one of these values, the counter
rises, allowing every transmittal to be uniquely identified.

Each counter starts from 1 and increases independently from the others.Â

Note  A transmittal numbering scheme can only be used by users from your
company and within the current workspace.

  1. Open the Manage Transmittal Values page. 
  2. In the Numbering Description box, enter the concept your transmittals will be associated with. For example, Sales Regions. 
  3. Under Numbering Codes/Values, press Add Entry and enter a numbering Code along with a corresponding Value. The code is what users see when they select the option. The value is used in the number itself.Â 

Add additional code and value pairs by repeating this process.

  1. To remove a pair from the list, select a row and press Remove Entry. 
  2. To include information at the bottom of every transmittal (for example, contact details or a disclaimer), enter the text in the Company Signature box. 
  3. To apply the transmittal values, press the Apply button. 

The next time you log in to FusionLive and create a new transmittal, the
numbering options will be available for selection.
