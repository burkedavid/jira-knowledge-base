  1. You can make a field mandatory, either always or depending on which status the issue is going to transition to. This allows you to require certain information at different points in an issueâs lifecycle. For example, a field called Final Comment, would only need to be mandatory when the issue was entering the Closed status. 

From the Mandatory for transition to drop-down menu, select the statuses for
which this field must be completed before the issue can enter them.Â

Alternatively, check the Select All box to make the field always mandatory.

  1. You can assign this field to be visible only for selected issue types. Fields which do not have issue types assigned apply to all issues. 
  2. From the Available to drop-down menu, select All issues or Selected Issue Types. 
  3. Press Apply. 
  4. If the Type is Drop Down or Multi Value, click on the Preferences button. 

To add a value, press Add and enter the name of the value, then press Apply.

Enter as many values as your field requires.Â

To make a value the default value, select it and click on Make Default.

To change the order the values are presented in, select a value and press the
up arrow to move it up the order or the down arrow to move it down.Â

To edit a value name, click on the relevant Edit button, change the name and
press Apply.Â

To delete a value, click on the relevant Delete button.

  1. If the Available to selection is Selected Issue Types, click on the Preferences button on the right to open the Issue Type hierarchy. Select the issue types that the field will apply to, then press Apply.
