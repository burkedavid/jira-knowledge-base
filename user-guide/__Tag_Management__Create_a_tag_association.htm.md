###  Create a tag association

You can use Viewer to associate any active tag in the Tag Register to the
document. Alternatively, you can create a new tag record which will be
automatically added to the tag register and associated with the current
document.

####  Associate an existing tag

You can associate any tag that exists in the Tag Register (and allows
associations) but is not already associated.

  1. In Viewer, press the + icon at the top of the tag list.

  1. In the Create Association window, enter part or all of a Tag Number.Â 
  2. Optionally, also enter a Classification and Type for the tag record. 
  3. Press the Search button.Â 
  4. The matching tag records are listed. To add one of these existing tags to the document, select it.  Note  If the tag is in a status that does not allow document associations, it will be grayed out and you will not be able to select it. 
  5. If you want to add a hotspot to the document for this tag record, check the Hotspot box. 
  6. Press Create Association. 
  7. If you checked the Add Hotspot box, move the hotspot to the position on the document where you want to add it (for example, over a component to which the tag refers). To change the size of the hotspot, hold down the ALT key while you are dragging. When the hotspot is in the correct position, click to place it and press OK.
