###  Request for information actions

There are a number of ways to respond to a request for information. The action
you perform will usually be dictated by the reason it was sent to you. That
is, if a request appears in your Assigned To Me folder, you are expected to
provide an answer. If it appears in your For My Comment or For My Information
folder, you may be expected to comment on the document.Ã‚

In addition to providing answers and comments, there are other actions
available which enable you to ensure that the request process is carried out
by the users most equipped to do so.

  * [ Provide Answer ](Provide_answer.htm#h) \- allows you to provide the requested information 
  * [ Mark As Read ](New_Topic1.htm#h) \- allows you to select multiple RFIs and remove their unread status without opening each one individually 
  * [ Forward RFI ](Forward_RFI.htm#h) \- allows you to forward the request to additional users who you think should be involved providing the information 
  * [ Reassign RFI ](Reassign_RFI.htm#h) \- allows you to send the request to users who you think are better equipped than yourself to respond to it. Reassigning an RFI removes it from your activities list 
  * [ Reopen RFI ](Reopen_RF.htm#h) \- allows you to open a closed RFI 
  * [ Edit Answer ](Edit_answer.htm#h) \- allows you to change your answer if the RFI is reopened 
  * [ Comment on RFI ](Comment_on_RFI.htm#h) \- allows you to comment on an RFI 

####  RFI alerts

Whenever you perform an action on an RFI (such as providing an answer, making
a comment or reassigning the RFI to other recipients), you are given the
option to notify some or all of the people who are involved in the request
(for example, the creator, the assignee and any recipients the RFI was sent to
for information or comment).
