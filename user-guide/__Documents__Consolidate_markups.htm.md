####  Consolidate markups

If you have made several markups in a document, you can consolidate them into
a single layer.  Note  If there is only one comment, this function is not
available.

Additionally, as part of the process of closing a Formal Review (see [ Close a
formal review ](../Activities/Close_a_FR.htm#h) ), Viewer allows lead
reviewers to consolidate the markups made by the review participants. Since
the lead reviewer has oversight, they can edit markups to ensure that the
consolidated layer contains only relevant and accurate information.

  1. Select the document you want to view.Ã‚ 
  2. From the Document Actions menu, select View. The viewer will open in a pop-up window. 
  3. Create any further markups of your own. Then press OK. 
  4. Press the Review button and select which annotations you want to include in the consolidated markup layer. 
  5. Select Consolidate markup from the Annotate menu. Give the consolidated layer a name and press OK. 
  6. Close the Viewer.
