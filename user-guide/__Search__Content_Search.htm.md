##  Content Search

Note  Only available if Content Search is enabled for the workspace.

Content Search allows you to search for documents in FusionLive by providing a
combination of keywords that may occur within either the text of the documents
or within the document metadata.Â

  1. To search for documents by content, click on the Content tab in the Advanced Search area. 
  2. The Content Search page provides a range of search criteria options. Enter the relevant search criteria into the form, entering text into fields and selecting from menus where appropriate.   

CriterionÂ Â Â  |  Description   
---|---  
Any fieldÂ Â  |  Content Search will search the document content as well as the reference and other metadata for this text.   
Content  |  Content Search will search the content of documents for this text.   
Reference  |  Content Search will search only the Reference field for this text.   
Metadata  |  Content Search will search other metadata fields for this text: Title, Revision, Status, Due Date and custom properties.   
Search all versionsÂ  |  Check to search all versions of documents. If unchecked, Content Search will only search current versions.Â

If you enter only part of a word, the search will automatically return all
results that include that string. For example, if you enter program, results
may include program, programs and programme.

  1. You can use the wildcard symbol % to search for variations on a search string. A wildcard symbol can stand in place of multiple unknown characters. For example, %ware may return results such including software, firmware or malware. 
  2. In the Any field or Content , you can enter search strings based on boolean logic by combining search terms with the logical operators AND or OR. For example, 2010 OR 2011 will return documents that contain either 2010 or 2011 in any field or in the content. Conversely, 2010 AND 2011 will only return documents that contain both of those years in any field or in the content.  Note  Putting the term in quotes will search for the whole term, ignoring the logical operator. 
  3. You can clear the search form at any time by pressing the Reset button. 
  4. When your search criteria selection is complete, press the Search button, or press Enter on your keyboard, to return a list of matching documents. 

Note  Leaving the search criteria form empty and pressing the Search button
will return all documents based on the default information.
