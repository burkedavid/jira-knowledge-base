###  Workspace groups

User groups allow you to create collections of users that can collectively be
given access to folders, participate in messaging or be added to roles in your
workspace, allowing you to manage membership quickly and easily.

Every workspace automatically contains groups for All Workspace Users and
Workspace Administrators. Additionally, groups are created for members of each
Company using the workspace.

Workspace Administrators and Group Administrators can also create custom
workspace groups.

####  Create custom workspace group

  1. In the User pane, select Workspace Groups and then press the Create Workspace Group button. 
  2. In the Create New Workspace Groups tab, enter the Group Name and a short Description. 
  3. To allow this custom group to be selected as an administrator, contributor or viewer of secure folders, check the Folders box. 
  4. To allow this custom group to be selected to received messages, check the Messaging box. 
  5. The custom group has an access level for non-secure folders which can be viewer or contributor. Any member of this group whose personal workspace access is lower will have the access level conferred by the group. Any member of whose personal access level is higher will retain that access level.Â 

To set the groupâs Access To Non-Secure Folders, select Viewer or
Contributor.Â
