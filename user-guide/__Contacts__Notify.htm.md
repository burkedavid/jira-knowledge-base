###  Notify user

When you are adding existing FusionLive users to a workspace, they will be
able to see the new workspace on their list of workspaces immediately but they
may not notice. You can use this feature to notify them that they have been
added to the workspace.

  1. In the Contacts page, search for the users and select them. 
  2. To send a notification, press Notify User from the Login Details menu. 

The notification email will inform the user of the addition of this workspace
to their workspace list.
