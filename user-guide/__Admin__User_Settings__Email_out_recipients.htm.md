####  Email out recipients

Email Out administrators manage the non-FusionLive users who can receive
messages and transmittals as emails. Secure Email Out administrators manage

read those messages and transmittals. The Email Out page lists the existing
Email Out users, displaying their status and whether they are Secure Email Out
users.
