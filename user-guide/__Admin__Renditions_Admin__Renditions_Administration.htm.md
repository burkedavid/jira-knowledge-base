##  Renditions Administration

The Renditions module allows Rendition Administrators to configure FusionLive
to automatically generate renditions for documents involved in an activity
such as Approvals or Formal Review. Additionally, if the Auto Rendition module
is enabled (see [ Auto Rendition Configuration
](Auto_Rendition_Configuration.htm#h) ), renditions can also be created
automatically when a document of a specified file type is uploaded.

A rendition is a read-only document (PDF or image format) which includes:

  * the document that was subject to the activity 
  * an optional cover sheet 
  * digital signature stamps for the comments made during the activity 

The rendition documents are generated from templates which you can configure
to display the information relevant to the outcomes of the selected activity
(for example, approval status or review decision code). Each template is then
associated with one or more of these outcomes so that, when the activity is
closed, the final status or decision code given to the document generates an
appropriate rendition document.

Note  Users of the Renditions functionality must be given a renditions role as
Administrators, Contributors or Viewers (see [ Role memberships
](../User_Settings/Role_membership.htm#h) ).
