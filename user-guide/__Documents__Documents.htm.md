#  Documents

The Documents area is where the workspace project documents are stored. The
folder structure is specific to the requirements of the project. Access to
documents is controlled on a folder-by-folder basis and is generally managed
by the workspace administrator. The folder security determines who can view,
upload and edit documents in the folders.

  1. When you view documents in a FusionLive folder, there are a number of icons indicating that the document possesses certain additional properties.Â
