##  Workspace Information

The Workspace Information tab should be used to display introductory and
contextual information about the project that the workspace is associated
with. For example, the scope of the project, its timescales, and who the
participants are likely to be.

In addition, as standard, the tab also contains:

  * Images - a bank of images that may be useful during the project (for example, company logos) 
  * Bulletins - information updates about the project 

Note  The content of your workspace homepage may be configured to comprise all
or only some of these features (see [ Create new workspace
](../Admin/Self_Admin/Create_new_w.htm) ).

The contents of the Workspace Information tab can be updated by Administrators
(see [ Company Workspaces ](../Admin/Company/C.htm) ).
