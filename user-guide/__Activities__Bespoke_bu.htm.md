##  Bespoke Business Processes

If the Business Process Management module is enabled, your Activities page may
have additional bespoke processes that enable you to take part in processes
specific to your organization.

The function of these processes, the metadata fields they present and the
actions available to you will depend on what the processes have been designed
to do, but in general they will operate in a similar manner to activities such
as Change Request, Technical Query and RFI.  
Process activities will be organized in some combination of standard folders:

  * Assigned To Me - process activities that have been sent to you for action 
  * For My Comment - process activities that have been sent to you for comment 
  * For My Information - process activities that have been sent to you for information 
  * Submitted By Me - process activities that you have sent 
  * All Workspace - all activities relating to this process across the workspace 

Ã‚

Actions available to you may include:

  * New - starts a new process instance 
  * Process Info - displays information about a selected process instance 
  * Filter - allows you to determine which processes to display according to status 
  * Download - allows you download any documents attached to the process 
  * Info - if the process is based around documents, provides document information 
  * Add to Briefcase - allows you to add an attached document to your workspace briefcase 
  * Public Comment - allows you to make a comment about the selected process instance 
  * Export - allows you to export the action item list in Excel or CSV format
