##  Deliverables Management Lifecycle

The Deliverables Management module lifecycle can be implemented as required to
allow you to control the passage of documents between your company, your
clients and other external parties, or internally within your own
organization.  
Documents are moved from one lifecycle status to the next as a result of the
deliverables activities performed by the relevant responsible users (for
example, a submittal being acknowledged by an internal document controller or
a decision code being applied at the close of a formal review by the lead
reviewer).

StatusÂ Â Â  |  Description   
---|---  
Pre-register  |  A new placeholder awaiting content to be supplied by internal engineers or an external party, such as a subcontractor or vendor.   
CanceledÂ Â Â  |  Placeholder is no longer required but remains in the system for information.   
New  |  Document content has been uploaded. The document can be sent as part of a submittal, which can undergo a formal review followed by a formal approval. Alternatively, the document can undergo a review or approval activity outside of the submittal process or be issued directly.   
Submitted  |  Document was one of a number of related documents collected into a submittal package and submitted to the selected recipient. The submittal can be acknowledged.   
Received  |  Submitted document is acknowledged. It can be sent for formal review or formal approval. If no activity is required, the submittal can be responded to, either accepting the document or, if the decision code has the type Rejected or Accepted-provide content, returning it for resubmission. Alternatively, it can be issued directly to the client or a wider audience.   
Reviewed  |  Reviewers have completed their formal review of the document. It can be issued, sent for formal approval or returned for resubmission.   
Note  If a Consolidator is involved in the review, their action of
consolidating comments for a subgroup of reviewers does not result in a change
of lifecycle status. Additionally, since the consolidator can either be part
of the client or an internal engineering subgroup, that role is not included
in the lifecycle diagram.  
Returned  |  Document has been returned to the sender for resubmission of a new version, beginning the process again.   
Approved  |  Document has passed formal approval. It can be issued or returned for resubmission.Â   
Issued  |  Issued to the client or wider audience.   
Rejected  |  Document was rejected during the approval process or the lifecycle status was changed manually. The document can be returned to the sender for resubmission.Â   
Accepted  |  Document is accepted by the client or wider audience. This status is not part of a system action. Instead, the lifecycle status must be manually changed to Accepted.

The Deliverables lifecycle workflow can be configured to match the needs of
your business in consultation with your FusionLive service team. You can
change the names of lifecycle statuses (see [ Status Configuration
](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Status_configuration.htm#h) ) and also add
custom statuses to your lifecycle (see [ Edit PM status
](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Edit_PM_St.htm#h) ). For example, custom
statuses may be used with the End Activity action which ends a deliverables
activity before it has been completed. Such custom statuses are not reflected
in the lifecycle shown here.
