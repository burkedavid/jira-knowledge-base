###  Weighting

The weighting field is used to show project progress based on specific
factors. These factors may vary per company, but they usually include
criticality, importance, urgency, complexity and/or risk. A weighting also may
be higher for documents with dependencies. Weighting is an integer between 1
and 100, and it shows how documents relate to each other based on these
factors. It is common to have the same weighting across a discipline, but it
is also possible in FusionLive to assign different weightings to documents
within a discipline. Weighting is used in the Deliverables Progress BI Report
to show the progress of a project based on these factors.
