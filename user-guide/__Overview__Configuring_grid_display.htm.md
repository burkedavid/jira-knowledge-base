###  Configuring Grid Display

In FusionLive, items such as documents, activities and tags are organized in
grids in which each entry is a row and its attributes are displayed in
columns. For many grids, you can configure the attribute columns that are
displayed and choose how to organize the displayed information.

  1. To change the display order according to a specific attribute, click on the relevant column header. This will organize the grid according to the contents of that column. Click it again to reverse the order. Alternatively, click the arrow to the right of the column header and select Sort Ascending or Sort Descending. 
  2. To add or remove columns, click on the arrow to the right of a column header and select Columns. Tick the names of columns you want to display. Untick the names of columns you want to hide. 
  3. In addition to showing the grid entries as an alphabetized list, you can group them according to the attributes contained in a column (for example, messages received organized by company or project). To do this, click on the arrow to the right of a column header and check the Show In Groups box. 

Click on the arrow to the right of the column header of the attribute you want
to group the grid by and select Group By This Field.
