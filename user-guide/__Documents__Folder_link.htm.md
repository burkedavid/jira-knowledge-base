###  Folder link

When you select a document or folder, its path is displayed in the status bar
at the bottom of the screen. You can send this link to other FusionLive users.

  1. To copy the folder path to your clipboard, click on the file icon. 
  2. To send the path to another FusionLive user in a Message or other activity, initiate the activity and paste the link into the Comments box. Alternatively you can send a folder link by external email. 

Note  When you receive a link to a folder, if you already have an instance of
FusionLive running, close it before clicking on the link.Ã‚
