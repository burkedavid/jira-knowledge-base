  5. If the Deliverables Management module is enabled, FusionLive calculates certain project dates by adding working days to other dates. For example, if a received document is returned on Feb 1, the system may automatically calculate a planned date for resubmission of Feb 21 by adding a resubmission period of 20 days to the date the document was returned.Â 

Only work week days are included in these calculations. You can select which
days constitute the work week for your project by unchecking the days which
are to be ignored.
