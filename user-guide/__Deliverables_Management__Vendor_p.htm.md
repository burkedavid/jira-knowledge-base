###  Vendor performance

The Vendor Performance dashboard provides a view of the timeliness and quality
of the documents submitted by an external party, such as a vendor, contractor
or supplier. The charts can be filtered to display data for specific
originators or disciplines. You can also filter to examine only placeholders,
documents that have not yet been submitted, initial submissions or
resubmissions. Additionally, you can look at all previous revisions of
documents or only the latest revisions.
