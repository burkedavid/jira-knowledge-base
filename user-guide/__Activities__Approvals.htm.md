##  Approvals

The Approvals activity type is a business process workflow which enables
documents to be submitted to nominated users for their approval, comment or
information. If the documents are circulated singly, the activity is called an
approval. If more than one document is associated with the activity, it is
known as a submittal package. Document approvals that belong to the same
submittal package have the same Submittal Number. You can perform actions or
make comments on single document approvals or to the entire submittal package
at once.Ã‚

The Approvals activity area is structured into the following folders:

  * Assigned To Me - documents that have been sent to you for approval 
  * For My Comment - documents that have been sent to you for comment 
  * For My Information - documents that have been sent to you for information 
  * Submitted By Me - approvals that have been circulated by you 
  * All Workspace Approvals - if you are an Approvals administrator, you can view all of the approvals that have been sent or received in this workspace.
