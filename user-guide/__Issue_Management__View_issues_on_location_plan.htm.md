###  View issues on a location plan

You can view all of the issues that have been added to one of the plan
documents that have been associated with the location hierarchy.

  1. In the Issues page, click on Location Pin View and select the plan you want to view. 
  2. On the plan, the location of each issue is indicated by a pin. The color pin indicates the status of the issue. Open issues which are overdue have a red outline. 
  3. The summary details of the displayed issues are listed in the Pin On Plan list to the left. You can filter the list by entering some information in the Search box. Only the pins corresponding to the filtered issues will be displayed. Delete the search term to show all issues again. 

Click on an issue in the list to highlight the associated pin on the plan.

  1. Hover over a pin to display a pop-up containing the summary details. This also highlights the issue in the list.
