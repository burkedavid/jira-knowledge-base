#  Home

Your FusionLive Home page contains introductory and ongoing information about
a project. It contains a selection of tabs that are configured when the
workspace is created and may include:

  * [ Workspace Information ](Workspace_Information.htm)
  * [ Activities ](Activit.htm)
  * [ Dashboard ](new_topic2.htm)

If the Deliverables Management module is enabled, the Activities and Dashboard
tabs are replaced by tabs specific to monitoring the progress of your
deliverables projects.

The Home page is displayed by default when you open a workspace to allow you
access any updates about the project.

Note  You can configure the default landing page if required (see [
Default_Home_Area ](../User_Settings/Preferences.htm#Default_Home_Area) ).
