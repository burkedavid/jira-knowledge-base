####  Checking out a document

Note  The download process can also be used to check out and, since it has
more options, it may be beneficial to use that instead.Â

  1. To check documents out for editing, select the documents. 
  2. From the Document Actions menu select Check-Out. The Download screen displays the documents you have selected to check out with an icon in the Check Out? column indicating whether they can be checked out.   

Icon  |  Description   
---|---  
![](../images/download_checkout.png) |  Document will be checked out.   
![](../images/download_warning.png) |  Document cannot be downloaded. This may be because it was deleted, you do not have access to its workspace folder or you do not have access to its lifecycle status.   
![](../images/download_soft_deleted.png) |  Document cannot be checked out because it was deleted.   
![](../images/download_read_only.png) |  You can view this document but not check it out. This may be because you only have Viewer access to the folder or workspace.   
![](../images/Is-link.gif) |  Document cannot be checked out because it is a link.   
![](../images/download_not_latest_version.png) |  Document cannot be checked out because it is not the latest version.

Note  Additionally, documents that have been merged with their parent document
to create a hybrid file cannot be checked out or downloaded individually.

  1. If some of the documents selected for download are CAD drawings, you will usually also want to download their associated files hierarchy. Select the Check out CAD associations box. 

If the documents selected for download possess attachments, these will also be
shown in the Download screen and will be downloaded along with the main
documents. To check the attachments out as well as the main documents, select
the Check out attachments box.

  1. Press Download to download and check out the selected files.Â 

On the Documents page a checked out document is identified by a blue Lock
icon. You can see who checked a document out by hovering the cursor over this
icon.
