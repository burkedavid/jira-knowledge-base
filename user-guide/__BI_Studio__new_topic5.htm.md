###  Filters

Filters allow you constrain the report output to only the relevant data. The
filtering action depends on the data type.Â

Every report starts with a date filter that allows you to specify the time
period to be considered by the report. The date is fundamental to the report
type (for example, Created Date for documents, Sent Date for distributions).

You can add further filtering conditions relating to values of specific fields
and measures. These are applied in the order in which they are listed in the
Filters pane and all of them must be met (in other words, a logical AND is
applied). Alternatively, you can combine these filter conditions into a custom
filter expression (see [ Custom filter expression
](Custom_filter_expressions.htm#h) ).

  1. To add a new filter condition, right click on the field you want to use as the subject of the condition in the Fields pane and select Create Filter. 
  2. The new filter condition is added to the end of the Filters list. To move it to another location in the list hover the cursor over the filter conditionâs Settings button and select Move Up or Move Down. Alternatively, click on the title bar of the filter condition and drag it up or down to the desired location in the list. 
  3. To remove a filter condition from the Filter List, hover the cursor over the Filter Conditionâs Settings button and select Remove Filter. 
  4. From the drop-down menu, choose a condition argument. The choices of argument depend on whether the data is of date or text type (see [ Date filter conditions ](Data_filter_conditions.htm#h) and [ Text filter conditions ](Text_fi.htm#h) for more information). 

Some condition arguments for text fields present the user with a drop-down
menu of values to choose from. However, you can also specify all or part of a
value. For example, that a document title contains the word confidential or
that the a reference number starts with 44H.Â

To specify a value, choose the appropriate condition and enter the value in
the text box.

  1. When you are finished configuring filter conditions, press the Apply button.
