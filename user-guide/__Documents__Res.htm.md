####  Resume upload

If you want to use other areas of FusionLive while an upload is in progress
(for example if you need to find document metadata information) you can do so
by minimizing the Upload window. Note You cannot perform another upload while
one is already in process.

  1. To perform other actions while an upload is in progress, click on the Minimize button at the top right corner of the Upload window. 

Note  If documents are being streamed when you minimize the window you will be
notified when that process is complete.

  1. To restore the Upload window, press Resume Upload on the menu bar.
