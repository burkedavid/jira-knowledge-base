####  Consolidate markups

If you have made several markups in a document, you can consolidate them into
a single layer.  Note  If there is only one markup, this function is not
available.

Additionally, as part of the process of closing a Formal Review (see [ Close a
formal review ](../Activities/Close_a_FR.htm#h) ), Viewer allows lead
reviewers or consolidators to consolidate the markups made by the review
participants. Since the lead reviewer has oversight, they can edit markups to
ensure that the consolidated layer contains only relevant and accurate
information.

  1. Select the document you want to view.Â 
  2. From the Document Actions menu, select View. The viewer will open in a pop-up window. 
  3. Select the markups that you want to include in the consolidated markup.Â
