  3. Select Project Tasks from the Projects menu and click on Done to view the tasks, along with their priority, phase, dates and to whom they are assigned. 

A number of task actions are available to you. These are described in [ Tasks
](../Activities/Task.htm) . However, from the Project Details page you can
also manage the task flow by Fast Forwarding or Rewinding the project.

Fast Forward allows you select current tasks to close so that tasks that
depend on their completion can begin.Â

Rewind allows you step back and reopen closed tasks. Any dependent tasks
cannot be worked on until the rewound tasks are closed again.
