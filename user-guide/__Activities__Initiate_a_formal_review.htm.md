####  Initiate a Formal Review

As part of the submittals workflow, submittal documents can be allocated to a
lead reviewer and a group of commenters to be reviewed. You can send more than
one submittal document on formal review at once, and they will share the same
formal review number, but each document is reviewed independently.

Note  Documents cannot be sent for review once they have been responded to.

  1. Open the submittal containing the documents you want to send for review. 
  2. Select the documents from the Not Responded area. 
  3. Click on Activities and select Formal Review. Complete the review details and press Send (see [ Formal Reviews ](New_Topic3.htm#h) for more information).
