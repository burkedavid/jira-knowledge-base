###  Category Admin

Note  Only available when the Categories setting is enabled.

Document categories allow you to organize the documents stored in your
workspace. When you upload a new document, you choose the document category
that it belongs in and supply the appropriate associated document metadata.
Users can then use this metadata to search for and manage these documents.

When a workspace is created, it is automatically populated with one document
category. This can be edited if required, and you can create new categories.

Note  A document category must be activated before it can be used.

####  Create a document category

You can add a new document category to the list.

  1. Open the Category Admin page. 
  2. Press the New Category button and select a category type. 

Category Type  |  Description   
---|---  
Standard Category  |  Standard document category type.   
Deliverables Category  |  Category with document fields that allow you to control and track documents shared with project clients (Deliverables Management module only).   
Externally Supplied CategoryÂ  |  Category with document fields that allow you to control and track documents shared with vendors and other external suppliers (Deliverables Management module only).   
Deliverables and Externally Supplied Category  |  Category with document fields that allow you to control and track documents shared with project clients and external suppliers (Deliverables Management module only).

  1. Enter a unique title in the Category Name box. 
  2. If the Filename Recognition module is enabled, enter a Separator character which the system will use to determine where the number ends and the revision begins. The default is _ . 

Note  The download process uses an underscore between the number and the
revision, so it is recommended to match this by keeping the default value.

  1. You cannot activate the category until you specify the properties of its Revision and Status fields (see [ Manage document fields ](Manage_document_fields.htm#h) ). For now, press the Apply button to create the category.
