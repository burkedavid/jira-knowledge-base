####  Reopen approval

Sometimes it may be necessary to reassess a closed approval; for example, when
an updated version of the document becomes available. Reopening a closed
approval and uploading a new document allows you retain the history of the
original.

Note  You cannot reopen a submittal package, only individual document
approvals.

  1. Locate the closed approval you want to reopen. This can done by filtering your All Workspace Approvals folder to display approvals with the appropriate closed status (for example, Accepted or Rejected). 
  2. Select the approval you want to reopen, then press the Reopen button. 

Note  When you reopen an approval, the project and recipient information
cannot be changed.

  1. In the Reopen Comment area, tell the user why youâre sending the document to them. 
  2. The Attachments area allows you to attach additional supporting documents to the approval.
