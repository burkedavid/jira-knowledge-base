####  Workspace templates

Another alternative method of streamlining the creation of workspaces is to
create workspace templates with standard settings from which new workspaces
can be created. To create a workspace template you have to be both Self
Administrator and a Company Administrator. The templates available to you are
the ones created by your company.

#####  Create template

  1. In the Self Administration pane, select Manage Workspace Templates. 
  2. Press the Create template button. 
  3. Enter a Name and brief Description for the template, then press Next. 

Note  You cannot edit the Status until the template has been finalized.

  1. Check the appropriate boxes to select the FusionLive functionality that you want workspaces created from this template to have. 

Warning  Contact Idox support to discuss what you enable and disable in this
section.

Press Next.

  1. By default your template will have two user groups: All Users and Workspace Administrators. You can add more groups by pressing Create Group (see [ Create custom workspace group ](../User_Settings/Workspace_groups.htm#h1) for more information). You can edit the properties of groups, or delete them. 

Note  It is not recommended that you delete the All Users or Workspace
Administrators groups.

  1. Create a standard folder structure for the template. To create a new folder select an existing folder under which to place the new one and press Add Folder.Ã‚ 

Provide the Folder Name.

By default sub-folders inherit the security settings of their parent folder.
If you want a sub-folder to have its own security, check the Secure Folder box
and Add and Remove administrator, contributor and viewer groups as required.

Press Create to add the new folder to the folder structure. Continue to add
more sub-folders until your folder structure is complete, then press Next.

  1. By default your template comes with four system Document Fields which are used to gather metadata about documents uploaded into the workspace. You can edit these, change the order they are presented in and add new custom fields (see [ Manage document fields ](../Workspace_Settings/Manage_document_fields.htm#h) ). 

Note  Before a template can be activated you must specify the settings for the
Revision and Status document fields.

  1. Press Close. 
  2. To make a template available for use, edit it and change its Status to Active.
