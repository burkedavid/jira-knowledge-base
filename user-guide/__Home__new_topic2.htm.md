##  Dashboard

The Dashboard tab displays the up-to-date results of a summary report of some
aspect of the project documents and activities. For example, a count of
document uploads or a list of overdue activities for the workspace. The
reports displayed in the Dashboard are selected by the Workspace
Administrator.

If the Deliverables Management module is enabled for your workspace, specific
Dashboard tabs display a range of data relevant to the performance of
documents in your deliverables workflow (see [ Deliverables Dashboards
](../Deliverables_Management/Deliverables_Dashb.htm) ). The exception to this
is the Activity Status report, which is available to all users.

  1. To view the reports on your dashboard, click on the Dashboard tab in the Home page. 
  2. To update the report to show the very latest data press the Refresh button. 
  3. If the Activity Status report is included in your dashboard, you can click on the columns to drill down to view the report data (see [ Drilling down to deliverables ](../Deliverables_Management/Drilling_down_to_deliverabl.htm) for more information). 
  4. To change the type of chart on which the report data is displayed, click on the Settings button for that report and select Chart Types... Choose a new Chart Type from the menu.Ã‚ 
  5. If you are a Workspace Administrator, you can choose a different report to display on your dashboard, or edit the existing one. Click on the Edit button, and configure the displayed report accordingly (see [ Reports ](../Reports/Re.htm) ).
