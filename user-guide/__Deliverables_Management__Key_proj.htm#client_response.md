###  Key project dates

The Deliverables and Externally Supplied categories contain dates which are
used to track a documentâs progress through the deliverables workflow. If
turnaround periods are set (see [ Turnaround Periods
](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Turnaround_period.htm#h) ), the dates by which a
document should be reviewed, responded to and resubmitted are automatically
calculated.

These project dates are the basis for the information displayed in the
Deliverables dashboard reports (see [ Deliverables Dashboards
](Deliverables_Dashb.htm#h) ).

Note  Project dates are based on the workspace time zone and these dates are
adjusted appropriately for users in different time zones. Consequently, some
dates may differ for users in different locations.Â

DateÂ Â Â  |  Description   
---|---  
Planned Submission Date  |  The planned deadline date for submitting the document. Selected when creating the placeholder. This carries forward through all document versions (until the reason for issue is changed) and enables reporting to compare the final resubmission date (if applicable) to the original planned date. The value on the current document version can be edited.Â   
Compared with the Actual Submission Date to determine whether a submittal was
on time or late in the Submission Timeliness report on the Vendor Performance
dashboard.  
Forecast Submission Date  |  The date to expect a document to be submitted. Set automatically to be the same as the Planned Submission Date when creating the placeholder. This carries forward through all document versions (until the reason for issue is changed) and can be changed to record known delays to the planned date but should only be used to track the initial submission.Â   
If the submittal has not been sent, this date will be used in the Work
Lookahead report on the Work Status dashboard and in the Overdue for
Submission report on the Expedite Work dashboard.  
Actual Submission DateÂ  |  The date set automatically when the external party sends the document on a submittal. This carries forward through all document versions (until the reason for issue is changed) and it cannot be changed.Â   
Compared with the Planned Submission Date to determine whether a submittal was
on time or late in the Submission Timeliness report on the Vendor Performance
dashboard.  
Planned Review DateÂ  |  The planned deadline date for closing the review. Calculated automatically by adding the Planned Review turnaround period to the date a formal review is sent. This is specific to each document version, so it is cleared when a new version is created. It cannot be changed.Â   
If the review is not closed, this date will be used in the Work Lookahead and
Workspace Activity Status reports on the Work Status dashboard.  
Actual Review Date  |  The date set automatically when a formal review is closed. This is specific to each document version, so it is cleared when a new version is created. It cannot be changed.   
Actual Approval DateÂ Â  |  The date set automatically when a formal approval is closed. This is specific to each document version, so it is cleared when a new version is created. It cannot be changed.   
Planned Return Date  |  The planned deadline date for responding to a submittal. Calculated automatically by adding the Planned Return turnaround period to the date a submittal is sent (Actual Submission Date or Actual Resubmission Date). This is specific to each document version, so it is cleared when a new version is created. Once the submittal is sent, the Planned Return date can be amended on the document from the submittal screen.Â   
If the submittal has not been returned, this date will be used in the Work
Lookahead report on the Work Status dashboard and in the Overdue for Return
report on the Expedite Work dashboard.  
Actual Return DateÂ  |  The date set automatically on the submitted document when a submittal response is sent (regardless of the response type). This is not carried forward into subsequent document versions and cannot be changed.   
Planned Resubmission Date  |  The planned deadline date for resubmitting the revised document. Calculated automatically by adding the Planned Resubmission turnaround period to the date that a submittal response is sent (Actual Return Date) if that response is the type that requires resubmittal. If the document is returned again, this date is overridden with a new date that is calculated the same way. The value on the current document version can be edited.Â   
Compared with the Actual Submission Date to determine whether a submittal was
on time or late in the Submission Timeliness report on the Vendor Performance
dashboard.  
Forecast Resubmission Date  |  The date to expect a document to be resubmitted. Set automatically to be the same as the Planned Resubmission Date. If the document is returned again, this date is overridden with a new date that is calculated the same way. This can be changed on a document after the response is sent to record known delays to the planned date.Â   
If a submittal has not been sent with the revised document, this date will be
used in the Work Lookahead report on the Work Status dashboard and in the
Overdue for Submission report on the Expedite Work dashboard.  
Actual Resubmission Date  |  The date set automatically when the external party sends the revised document in another submittal. If the document is returned again, this date is cleared and then repopulated with a new date. It cannot be changed.Â   
Compared with the Planned Resubmission Date to determine whether a submittal
was on time or late in the Submission Timeliness report on the Vendor
Performance dashboard.  
Planned Issue Date  |  The planned deadline date for issuing the document. Selected when creating the placeholder. This carries forward through all document versions (until the reason for issue is changed). The value on the current version can be edited.   
Forecast Issue Date  |  The date to expect a document to be issued. Set automatically to be the same as the Planned Issue Date when creating the placeholder. This carries forward through all document versions (until the reason for issue is changed) and can be changed on the current version to record known delays to the planned date.Â   
If the document has not been issued, this date will be used in the Work
Lookahead report on the Work Status dashboard and in the Overdue for Issue
report on the Expedite Work dashboard.  
Actual Issue Date  |  The date set automatically when the document is sent on an issue transmittal. This is specific to each version, so it is cleared when a new document version is created. It cannot be changed.Â   
Client Response Date  |  The date the client responds to an issue transmittal. This can be set manually if the information is useful, but it is not tracked on the dashboard reports. This carries forward through all document versions (until the reason for issue is changed). The value on the current version can be edited.   
Due Date  |  A system field that cannot be disabled. This is not used in the Deliverables Management dashboards and is not set by the turnaround periods. Since it duplicates other fields, its use is not recommended unless it is defined in your business process for a specific purpose.
