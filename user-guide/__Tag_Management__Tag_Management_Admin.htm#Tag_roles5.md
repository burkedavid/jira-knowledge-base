##  Tag Management Administration

###  Tag roles

There are four administration roles associated with tag management. Any
workspace user can be added to these roles by the workspace administrator.

  * Tag Manager - can manage tag records in FusionLive. Management tasks include creating, editing and deleting tag records and managing their associations to documents, other tags and purchase orders, as well as importing and exporting tag records (in addition to the permissions of the Tag Viewer, Tag Extractor and Tag Validator roles). 
  * Tag Validator - can validate tags (in addition to the permissions of the Tag Viewer role). 
  * Tag Extractor - can send documents for tag extraction (in addition to the permissions of the Tag Viewer role). 
  * Tag Viewer - can view tag information and associated documents in FusionLive but cannot add or change them. They can also export tags with associations. 

Ã‚

  1. To add and remove users to these roles, select Tag Roles in the User pane of the Administration page. The list of workspace users and groups and which Tag Roles they have is displayed. 
  2. You can filter this list by First Name or Last Name to locate specific user, by Company or by Type (users, groups or all users). You can also filter the list to show only the users who have specific roles (for example, only Tag Managers). 
  3. To add a user to a role, check the appropriate box for that user.  Note  If you select Tag Validator or Tag Extractor, the Tag Viewer box is automatically checked and cannot be unchecked because those roles need the Tag Viewer permissions. Similarly, if you select Tag Manager, all of the roles are also checked. 
  4. When you have finished configuring the role users, press the Apply button.
