#  Issue Management

FusionLive Issue Management module enables you to manage the processes
involved in inspecting and resolving issues in on-site projects. Issues are
created on mobile devices and uploaded to FusionLive once the devices are
online.

A number of users take part in the inspection process.

  * Issue User - Creates issues, either via the FusionLive Connect app or using FusionLive in a web browser. They can also view issues theyâve previously created. 
  * Issue Assignee - Assigned issues to provide remedial works and hand the issue back ready for inspection. Issue Assignees can also create new issues when required. 
  * Issue Manager - Adds the relevant metadata to new issues and assigns them to appropriate Issue Assignees. Also reassigns or rejects issues when required, and closes completed issues. 
  * Issue Administrator - Configures the Issue Management module settings and also has administrative control of all issues in the workspace. 

  1. In FusionLive, click on Issues to display the Issues page. 
  2. The Issues Dashboard tab displays statistics that offer a high-level view of the progress and efficiency of the issue management in your workspace.
