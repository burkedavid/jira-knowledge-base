####  Schedules

An individual document can be given a Schedule of reasons for issue which can
be imported from the milestone chain or created specifically for that document
(see [ Deliverables Management Schedule
](../Documents/Deliverables_Management_Schedu.htm#h) ).Ã‚

For each reason for issue in the schedule, the relevant planned and forecast
submission or issue dates (depending on whether the document category is an
Externally Supplied type, a Deliverables type or a Deliverables and Externally
Supplied type) are recorded. Whenever the reason for issue of the document is
changed, the dates associated with it in the schedule will automatically be
applied.

The progress of the submission and issue of documents can be viewed on the
Document Schedule Progress report dashboards (see [ Document Schedule Progress
reports ](Document_schedule_prog.htm#h) ).
