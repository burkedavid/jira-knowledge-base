##  Upload Audit Report

The upload audit reports display the document packages you have attempted to
upload into the workspace but which have not been successful.Ã‚

If one of your uploads gets stuck or you have canceled the upload process, the
system may block you from uploading the same document reference again until
you delete the failed upload.

###  Upload audit tab

The Upload audit tab displays document packages created by the upload process.

Users can see only their own packages. Super Administrators can see packages
for the whole workspace (but not their own).

####  Deleting packages from the upload audit

Workspace Administrators and Super Administrators can delete document packages
directly from the Upload Audit report. When you delete a document package, the
upload will be cancelled and, if a reference numbering scheme using a counter
is in use, that counter will be freed up.

  1. Open the Upload Audit tab in the Reports page. 
  2. Select the document packages you wish to delete. 
  3. Press the Delete button.
