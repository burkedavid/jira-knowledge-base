####  Create markups

You may want to add text comments and other annotations to a document. This is
done by adding a new markup layer. A document can have several markup layers
and, once the review process is complete, a version of the document containing
the relevant markups can be published.

When you create a markup layer on a document, only you can edit it.

Note  If the Markup on review only feature is enabled, markups can only be
made on documents on formal review and they can only be made by recipients of
the review (commenters, consolidators and lead reviewers) or a Deliverables
Activity administrator.

  1. Select the document you want to view and annotate.Â 
  2. From the Document Actions menu, select View. The viewer will open in a pop-up window. 
  3. If the document has no markups, the Markup List is opened on the left hand side, containing a new markup. The edit icon indicates that you can add annotations to this markup.

If the document already contains markups, these are listed. To display the
annotations, check the box for that markup.

To view the annotations for all markups, check the Select All box.

If any of the existing markups were created by you, the most recent one is
highlighted and enabled for adding annotations, displaying the Edit icon.Â

To enable a different markup layer, click to select it. Note Only one layer
can be enabled for adding markups.Â

Note  You can only add annotations to your own markups. Markups created by
other users are grey and have a lock icon.

Alternatively, to create a new markup click on the New Markup icon in the menu
bar.

  1. The status of NEW is displayed until you add an annotation, after which it will automatically change to SAVING. Once the status has vanished, the markup has been saved. Any further changes you make to this or any other markup will continue to be automatically saved.Â 
  2. The markup is automatically given a generic name. To edit this, click on the Edit icon in the corner of the markup and type a new name. Click on the Save icon to save it. 

The markup always displays your name and the date and time it was created.

  1. Use the annotation tools to add annotations to the markup.

the replacement text in the linked comment.

Images  |  Insert  |  Insert images into the markup.   
Attachments  |  Insert  |  If the Enable ability to add attachments within the viewer feature is enabled, you can embed files at a specific point in the markup. Note Embedded attachments can only be accessed from the Viewer, however they may be added into the review summary when a Formal Review is closed.   
Stamps  |  Insert  |  Apply stamps selected from the stamp templates list or add your own.   
Symbols  |  Insert  |  Insert engineering symbols selected from the drop-down menu.   
Measurements  |  Measure  |  Add distance, perimeter and area measurements. Note By default the measurement tool snaps the start and end of the measurement to features in the document. To disable this, uncheck the Enable snapping box.   
  
  
Note  The new viewer does not support Bookmarks.

  1. Adjust the placement, size, color and opacity by clicking on the annotation and selecting from the Style menu, if required.Â 
  2. To add external context to an annotation, select it and click on the Link icon. Enter a URL to link the annotation to an internet resource or a page number to link the annotation to a page in the same document.Â 
  3. To add a comment about an annotation, select it and click on the Comment icon. Comments appear in the Comments panel on the right hand side.Â 

If the Enable ability to add attachments within the viewer feature is enabled
you can add an attachment to the comment. In the Add reply box, click on the
attachment icon, locate the document you want to upload and press Open.

  1. To delete an annotation, select it and press Delete on your keyboard. 
  2. Click on the Refresh button in the top right corner at any time to display any changes made by other users while you have been working.Â 
  3. When you are finished, close the pop-up window.Â 
  4. To optionally notify other users that the markups have been created, select the recipients and press Send.Â  Note  You cannot notify users if the document is on a formal review. 
  5. In FusionLive, the document now has a markup icon indicating that it contains markups
