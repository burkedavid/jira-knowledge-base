###  Activity Reminders/Escalations

You can configure FusionLive to provide reminders and nominate users to be
notified on escalation for different types of activity.Â

Reminder notifications can be sent a specified number of days before the
activity due date. You can configure up to five intervals for reminders. The
configured reminder intervals apply to all selected activities.

  1. In the Workspace Settings pane, press Activity Reminders/Escalations. 
  2. Configure up to five reminders by entering the number of days prior to the activity due date in the appropriate boxes. 
  3. Once reminder intervals have been set, select which activities should send reminder emails according to that schedule.

Reminders can be sent for:

  * Messages 
  * Approvals 
  * RFIs 
  * Technical Queries 
  * Submittals 
  * Formal Reviews 
  * Formal Approvals 

Check the Send Reminder boxes to allow each message type to send activity
reminders. For Approvals and Formal Reviews you can also send the reminder
notifications to commenters.

Note  If you deselect all of the activity checkboxes, activity reminders and
escalations will be turned off and all settings you have entered will be
lost.Â

  1. On the next working day after the activity due date, the reminder will be escalated to a nominated user. For each activity type, select a user from the Escalate To drop-down list. 
  2. If you have the Business Process Management module enabled, you can also send reminders and escalations to selected business processes. 
  3. Most activities alerts are document-focused, but a formal review may contain many documents and it is undesirable for users to receive many alerts notifying them of the same activity step (for example, when all of the documents in a formal review have been reviewed and are ready for consolidation or notifying the lead reviewer when the review is ready to be closed). If this is likely to be the case in your workspace, check the Summary Alerts per Activity/Process box. This will send a single alert listing all of the documents involved in the review instead of an alert for each document. 

When you enable the summary alert, an alert configuration is automatically
created. You can edit the content of this if required (see [ Alert
Configuration ](Alert_configuration.htm#h) ).

  1. Press Apply.
