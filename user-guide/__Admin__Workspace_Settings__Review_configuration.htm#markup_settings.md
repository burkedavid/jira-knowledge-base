####  Review Configuration

Several settings can be configured to determine how formal reviews behave in
the workspace.

#####  Review markup settings

When the lead reviewer opens a document containing markups in the Viewer, you
can determine which markups will be displayed by default.

  1. In the Workspace Settings tab of the Admin page, click on Deliverables. 
  2. Select the Review Configuration tab. 
  3. Select which markups you want the lead reviewer to see when they open a marked-up document in Viewer. 

Review Markup Setting  |  Description   
---|---  
All  |  All markups will initially be displayed.   
Consolidated  |  Only the latest markup made by either the lead reviewer or consolidator will initially be displayed. If neither the lead reviewer nor the consolidator has added a markup, then all will be shown in edit mode.   
None  |  No markups will initially be displayed.
