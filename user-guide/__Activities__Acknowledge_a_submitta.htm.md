###  Acknowledge a submittal

When you receive a submittal, it needs to be acknowledged to let the sender
know that the documents have been received. When you acknowledge a submittal,
you acquire it and become responsible for yourself or other users responding
to it.

Note  If a Deliverables Activity administrator created the submittal on behalf
of another user and included themselves as a recipient, the submittal will be
automatically acknowledged.

  1. To acknowledge a submittal and acquire it to respond to, locate it in the submittal list. 
  2. Press the relevant Acknowledge button. 

The submittal documentsâ lifecycle status will change to Received, the
Acknowledge button will be replaced by the response progress bar and the
submittal recipients will be notified.
