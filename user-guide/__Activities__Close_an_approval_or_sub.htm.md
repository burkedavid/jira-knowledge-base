####  Close approval or submittal

When you have assessed the documents circulated with each approval in a
submittal package, you can select an action which will close the approval. For
example, that you have approved the documents. Depending on the permissions
you have, you can close approvals individually, or close the entire submittal
package with a single action.

Closing an approval or submittal prevents other users from commenting.

If the Renditions module is enabled and the final approval comment is
associated with a rendition template, when the approval or submittal is closed
a rendition document will be generated.

Note  An approval summary document is a system generated document. You can
view which documents are system generated and which are uploaded by users by
adding the Document Origin column to the Documents grid.Â

An approval documentâs rendition history is part of the action history in
its Document Information page (see [ Transmittal History
](../Documents/Transmittal_History.htm#h) ). It can also be found in its View
Approval page.
