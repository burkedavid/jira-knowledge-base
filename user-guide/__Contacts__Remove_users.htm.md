###  Remove users from workspace

If user accounts are no longer required, you can remove them from one or more
workspaces. It may be necessary to reassign some of their user permissions
before removing them (see [ Manage Reassigns
](../Admin/Self_Admin/New_Topic.htm#h) ).Â

Note  You cannot remove users who are currently logged in or are the only
administrator for a secure folder.

  1. In the Contacts page, search for the users. 
  2. Select the users that you want to remove.Â 
  3. Press the Workspace Action button and select Remove User From Workspace. 
  4. If you selected a single user, select which workspaces to remove them from. If the user is locked or deactivated in a workspace, this is indicated. Press Done to confirm the removal. 

You will be sent an email report of to the success or failure of your removal
attempt. Any reasons for failure will be listed. Correct these (for example,
by reassigning permissions) before trying again.Â

If you selected multiple users, the removal will be limited to the current
workspace. Confirm that you want to complete the removal.Â
