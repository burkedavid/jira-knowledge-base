###  Schedule BI Reports

You can configure a BI Report to run on a particular date or at recurring
intervals. Once reports have been scheduled, they can be administered from the
Scheduled Reports tab of the Reports page.Â

####  Create a BI Report schedule

You can create a schedule for any BI Report.Â

Note  A report may only have one schedule at a time. If a report is already
scheduled, its schedule icon will be illuminated. You can edit an existing
schedule (see [ View and edit BI Report schedules ](View_edit_B.htm#h) ).Â
