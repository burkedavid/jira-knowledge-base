##  Deliverables Document CategoriesÂ

The Deliverables Management module provides additional document category types
in addition to the standard type. When you upload documents into a
deliverables workspace, the categories available to you will be one of these
types. Ask your Workspace Administrator for more information.

Category TypeÂ  |  Description   
---|---  
Standard  |  A simple category type. All non-deliverables management categories are standard categories.Â   
Note  Documents from standard categories cannot be used in deliverables
activities (submittal, formal review, formal approval) because these
activities require specific date and system fields to track progress. In a
deliverables workspace, only create a standard category for general documents,
such as meeting notes, that do not need to undergo an activity.Â  
Deliverables  |  A category type for documents that will either be distributed internally or issued to a client externally. This type of category tracks Percentage Complete, Estimated Hours, Issue date and Client Response date.   
Externally SuppliedÂ  |  A category type for documents that will be supplied from an external source (for example, vendors, contractors or suppliers) and where the submission should be tracked. Such categories record submission dates, return dates and resubmission dates.Â   
Deliverables and Externally Supplied  |  A combination category type intended to contain documents supplied by external parties as well as documents that have to be issued to a client. This category type includes all of the additional fields in the Deliverables category and Externally Supplied category types.   
  
Â Â  
Note  Documents created internally should use the Deliverables category type.
If you use Externally Supplied category types, the internal company will be
included on the dashboards as a vendor and the metadata for the documents will
include fields that will never be used (for example, submitted dates) some of
which are mandatory.

These categories contain fields corresponding to system properties shared by
all documents assigned to them (see [ Manage document fields
](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Manage_document_fields.htm#h) for more
information).Â
