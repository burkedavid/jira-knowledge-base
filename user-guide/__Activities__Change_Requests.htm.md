##  Change Requests

The Change Request activity type is a business process workflow which enables
product or system change requests to be submitted to other users. Change
requests allow users to outline the required change and agree on the time and
cost impact to the project.

The change request activity area is structured into the following folders:

  * Assigned To Me - change requests that have been sent to you 
  * For My Comment - requests that have been sent to you for comment 
  * Submitted By Me - requests that you have sent
