####  Associate a document with a location

You can associate a floor plan document with a location to allow users to
identify the exact site of the reported issue.

![](../../images/issues associated docuemnt.png) Â

Note  Only one document can be associated with a location and no parent or
child in the location hierarchy can already have an associated document.
Locations descending from other nodes may have an associated document however.

Note  The floor plan document must be a PDF.Â

The associated document will be available when creating issues at the selected
location and any location below it in the hierarchy.Â When the user creates an
issue they will be able to place a pin on the floor plan to indicate the site
of the issue.

  1. In the Manage Location tab, expand the location hierarchy and select the location you want to associate a floor plan with. 
  2. Click on Associate Document. Locate the floorplan PDF document in your workspace, select it in the Available Documents pane and press Add to move it the Selected Documents pane.Â 
  3. Press Done. 

The location is identified by the blue Associated Document icon. If a location
with an associated document is also a default location, the icon contains a
red pin instead of a blue one.
