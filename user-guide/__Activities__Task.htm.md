##  Tasks

Note  Tasks are only available when the Programme Management module is
enabled.

The FusionLive Programme Management module enables sub-projects which allow
you to organize programmes of work within the overall project. These
programmes focus on a subset of the folder structure and nominated workspace
users are assigned to roles which allow them to perform the automated tasks
generated from the workflows. If you are assigned to a role in a sub-project,
the tasks available to you to perform can be accessed from the Tasks section
of the Activities Page.
