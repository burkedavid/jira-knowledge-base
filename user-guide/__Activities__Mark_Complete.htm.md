####  Mark Complete

Once a print job has been submitted for print, a reprographics manager must
review it and then mark it as complete. This can be done with print jobs in
either the draft or submitted status.

Note  If the print job is associated with a transmittal, changing the status
to complete does not change the status of the corresponding transmittal
distribution.

  1. In the Repro Jobs folder, select the print job that you want to complete. 
  2. Review the contents of the job and make sure that is okay to be sent to print. If the job is in the draft status, you will be able to edit any details before completion. If the job is in the Submitted status, you will be presented with a non-editable form to review. 
  3. To send the job to print at the nominated location, press the Mark Complete button in the Reprographics menu bar.
