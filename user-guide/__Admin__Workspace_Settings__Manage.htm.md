###  Manage Code Tables

Note  Available when Document Numbering is enabled.

Code tables allow you to store lists of metadata choices that can be selected
to create part of the reference number when a document is being uploaded to a
category (see [ Edit Reference field ](Edit_reference_f.htm#h) ). Code tables
can be used in multiple categories within a workspace.

####  Create a code table

You can add a code table to the list.

  1. In the Workspace Settings pane, open the Manage Code Tables page. 
  2. To create a new code table, press the New Code Table button. 
  3. Enter a name in the Code Table Name field. 
  4. A code table is made up of entries, each of which has a code that will be used internally and a label which is displayed to users. To create an entry, press the Add button and enter a Code and Label in the relevant fields. 
  5. If you want to make this entry available for use, check the Enabled box. 
  6. Press Apply to add the entry to the code table. 
  7. Repeat this process to add further entries to your code table. 
  8. When your code table is complete, press the Apply button at the bottom of the page.
