###  Attachments

Attachments are used to store documents together. For example, a signed PDF
version of a document could be attached to the native version of that
document. If a document contains an attachment, it will display a paperclip
icon alongside the document. Clicking on this icon will display the
attachments linked to the document by a dotted line. Documents can have
multiple attachments which can be revised individually. You can view
attachments and their associated metadata the same way as with documents.

Note  In searches attachments can be found separately from their parents. An
icon with a page and paper clip indicates that the document is attached to a
parent.Ã‚

####  Add Attachments

In all workspaces, you can add attachments to documents during Upload. In
Business Rules workspaces, the addition of attachments is strictly controlled
by the upload process. In workspaces without Business Rules, while you are
uploading documents, you have the option of attaching them to other documents
in the upload or to documents already existing in the workspace. You can also
select documents in the upload and attach other documents to them. These
options are available from the Options menu in the Files page of the upload
process (see [ Uploading documents ](Uploading_documents.htm) for full
information).

You can also add attachments directly to documents in the workspace, either by
manually selecting a workspace document and uploading a document attachment
or, in workspaces without business rules, by allowing FusionLive to
automatically determine which document an attachment belongs with.
