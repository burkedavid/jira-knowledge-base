####  Contracts

In the Deliverables Management module, contracts are used for reporting
purposes and in determining the turnaround periods for the deliverables.

  1. To manage deliverables contracts, in the Admin page, expand the Workspace Settings pane and click on Deliverables. 
  2. A project may quickly accumulate a large number of contracts. To locate a contract you can reorder the contract list alphabetically according to a specific field by clicking on the column heading for that field. Click on the heading again to reverse the order.
