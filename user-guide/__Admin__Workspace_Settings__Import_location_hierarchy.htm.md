####  Import location hierarchyÂ

In order to import this information, each top-to-bottom hierarchical path must
be entered in a row of an Excel spreadsheet.

If you import a new hierarchy into a workspace where one already exists, the
existing one will be overwritten. You can do this as often as you want until
an issue has been created against the hierarchy. Once an issue exists, the
import function will no longer be available.

  1. Open an Excel spreadsheet and rename Sheet1 as Location Hierarchy. 
  2. In Row A enter Level1 Name in the first column and Level1 Code in the second column. Repeat for the subsequent column pairs, for as many levels as your hierarchy contains. 
  3. In each subsequent row, enter the location names and location codes for the location paths that describe the top-to-bottom hierarchy. Note that where several rows contain the same location name/location code pair, the location code for only the first row needs to be filled in. The remaining matching rows will be assumed the same during the import.Â 

Note  Location code must be 1-5 characters and may consist of letters (A-z),
numbers (0-9) and the hyphen character (-). For example, Am-01.

  1. When you are finished, save the spreadsheet. 
  2. In FusionLive, in the Workspace Settings tab of the Administration page, select Location Hierarchy. 
  3. On the Manage Location tab, click on Import. 
  4. Click on Choose File, locate the Excel document and press Open. 
  5. Press Import.
