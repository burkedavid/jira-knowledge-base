#####  Review Chain Sender setting

When a document enters a review chain (see [ Create a formal review
](../../Activities/Create.htm#h) ), the user who closes a review in the chain
is made the sender of the next review, and receives notifications when the
review is completed.

Instead, you can enable the sender of the first review in the chain to be the
sender for every review in the chain, and receive all relevant notifications.

  1. In the Workspace Settings tab of the Admin page, click on Deliverables. 
  2. Select the Review Configuration tab. 
  3. Check the Review Chain Sender: Original sender box. 
  4. Press Apply.
