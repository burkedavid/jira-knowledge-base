##  Formal Approvals

Note  Available in Deliverables Management workspaces only.

The Formal Approval activity is a business process workflow which enables
deliverables documents to be formally approved or rejected into the project by
a team of approvers. Formal approval usually follows formal review. Documents
for approval must be responded to within a given date.Â

The Formal Approvals activity area is structured into the following folders:

  * Assigned To Me â approvals assigned to youÂ 
  * For My Information â approvals assigned to you for your information only 
  * Submitted By Me â approvals you have created 
  * All Workspace Approvals â if you are a Deliverables Activity administrator you can view all of the formal approvals in the workspace 

The top level Formal Approval folder displays the number of formal approvals
which have been assigned to you and which have not been approved.
