####  Review Types

Formal reviews may be of one or more review types. Each review type is used
for a specific purpose and is associated with an appropriate choice of
decision codes and PM statuses that will be applied when the review is created
and completed. Since this functionality is optional, review type options will
not be displayed until at least one review type has been created.

Note  If no review types are created, a review type of Standard is made
available. By default, this has No Status Change applied when the review is
created and a closing PM status of Reviewed, but these values can be edited.
