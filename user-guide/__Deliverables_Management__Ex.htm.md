###  Expedite WorkÂ Â Â

The Expedite Work dashboard shows due or overdue submissions from external
parties, documents due or overdue to be returned and documents due or overdue
to be issued to the client or a wider audience. The charts can be filtered to
display the data for specific originators or disciplines.Â

You can drill down into the overdue sections to see the documents and take
action to expedite the process straight from the results page.

  * Overdue for Submission - documents whose Forecast Submission Date has passed and are therefore overdue, as well as documents that are due today, next week or later. You can send the external party a message requesting the documents. 
  * Overdue for Return - documents whose Planned Return Date has passed, as well as documents that are due today, next week or later. You can prompt those responsible to make sure these deliverables are returned to the relevant external parties. 
  * Overdue for Issue - documents whose Forecast Issue Date has passed. The documents can be added to a transmittal and issued straight to the client from the drill-down results.
