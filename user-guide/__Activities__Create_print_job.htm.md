###  Create a print job

To print one or more documents at a nominated location, you can create a print
job from within the Reprographics activity.Â

  1. Press the New Repro button in the Reprographics toolbar. The New Repro Job tab presents a number of fields to help you determine the print job details. 

Note  Fields marked by an asterisk (*) must be completed.

  1. Nominate the print shop that the job will be sent to by selecting from the Print Shop drop-down menu. The print shop contact details are displayed. 

Note  If the print shop that you want to use is not in this list, you can add
it (see [ Request Print Shop ](Request_Print_Sho.htm#h) ).

  1. The Job Name field is automatically populated with a job name constructed from your company name and the date and time that the job was initiated. You can change this by erasing the contents of the field and typing a new job name. 
  2. The print job includes a date and time by which the job must be printed and delivered. Click on the field next to Deliver By Date and choose the date. Click on the arrow next to the Deliver By Time field and select either AM (for a morning delivery), PM (for an afternoon delivery) or a specific hour of the day. 
  3. You can add accounting information to the job by specifying the following details in the appropriate fields: Cost Centre, Account Reference and Purchase Order Ref. The Other Info field allows you to provide additional accounts information or any other instructions regarding the job. 
  4. To attach the documents to be printed, press the Add button in the Documents section. Note If the documents include CAD drawings, the drawings and all their references should be sent as individual PDF renditions to ensure that all the information is printed.Â 

In the Select Documents window, navigate to the relevant document folder,
select the document to be printed and press Add. You can select further
documents to add using the same process. When you have selected all the
documents you want to add, press Done.

For each document to be printed, provide the following settings:

  * Scale - specify the scale the document is to be printed at (default is 100%) 
  * Media - select the print medium (default is paper) 
  * Fold - tick if the printed document is to be folded 
  * Punch - tick if the printed document is to be hole-punched 
  * Color - tick if the document is to be printed in color (black and white if unchecked) 
  * Notes - enter any notes to the printer specific to the document 
  * Copies - specify the number of copies 

  1. The Recipients field contains the names of the users to whom the printed document will be delivered. You can populate this field by entering their names directly and selecting from the auto-complete options.Â 

Alternatively, you can add users by clicking on the To link to open the Select
Users window.

The Select Users window lists the users and user groups available to receive
the printed documents. The list contains workspace Users, Email Out users and
user Groups and you can filter the list by selecting one of these options from
the Type drop-down menu. Select a user or group in the list and then press the
Add button to include them in the To list as appropriate. If you want to
remove a user, select them and press the Remove button.

For each recipient, provide the following settings:

  * Batches - specify how many batches of the printed documents the user should receive (for individual use this will usually be one, but if the recipient is the contact for a department, they may require multiple sets) 
  * Include Transmittal - check to include the transmittal information with the printed documents 
  * Alert By Email - check to send an email to the recipient when the print job is ready 
  * Reason For Issue - enter the reason that the job is being sent to the recipient 
  * Notes To Print Shop - enter any information that the print shop needs in order to be able deliver the job to this recipient (for example, door entry procedures) 

  1. If, at any time, you want to save your changes and continue working on the print job, press the Save button. Alternatively, you can save your changes and close the New Repro Job window by pressing Save and Quit. 
  2. When the print job is ready to submit, press the Submit Repro Job button. A reprographics manager will review the job and mark it as complete, sending the job to the nominated printer (see [ Mark Complete ](Mark_Complete.htm#h) ).Â
