###  Locking

Documents can be locked to prevent them from being revised. You will see a
lock icon next to the documents that you have locked. You can see who has
locked the document via the document's information area.

Note  A document is also automatically locked while it is in a submittal.
However, document controllers may still update some of its metadata.

  1. Open the Documents page. 
  2. Select the folder that contains the documents you wish to lock. 
  3. Check the box associated with the desired documents. 
  4. Select Lock from the Document Actions menu.
