####  Lifecycle status

In a PM-enabled workspace, approvals pass through the statuses of a lifecycle.
For approvals that are assigned to or were created by yourself, you can change
the PM lifecycle status.

  1. In the Assigned To Me or Submitted By Me activities page, select the approval whose status you want to change. 
  2. Press the Lifecycle button. Select the new status and press Next. 
  3. You can send a message or create an approval submittal to notify users of the change you have made, or do nothing. Select from the drop-down list and, if required, enter any recipient and other information, then press Finish.
