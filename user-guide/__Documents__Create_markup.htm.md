####  Create markups

You may want to add text comments and other annotations to a document. This is
done by adding a new markup layer. A document can have several markup layers
and, once the review process is complete, a version of the document containing
the relevant markups can be published.

When you create a markup layer on a document, only you can edit it.

Note  If the Markup on review only feature is enabled, markups can only be
made on documents on formal review and they can only be made by recipients of
the review (commenters, consolidators and lead reviewers) or a Deliverables
Activity administrator.

  1. Select the document you want to view and annotate.Â 
  2. From the Document Actions menu, select View. The viewer will open in a pop-up window. 
  3. To create a markup, select New markup from the Annotate drop-down menu. 
  4. Use the annotation tools to add text and shapes.

Note  For a full description of the annotation options available, see the
Viewerâs Help documentation.

  1. When you are finished, select Save markup as from the Annotate menu. Enter a name for the markup and press OK. 
  2. Select Close markup from the Annotate menu and then close the pop-up window. 
  3. In FusionLive, the document now has a markup icon indicating that it contains markups.
