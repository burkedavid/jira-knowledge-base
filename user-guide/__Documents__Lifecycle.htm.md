###  Lifecycle

Note  Only available when the Document Lifecycle module is enabled.

If you are an administrator on the status, you can manually update a
documentâs lifecycle status (see [ Status Configuration
](../Admin/Workspace_Settings/Status_configuration.htm#h) ).

  1. In the Documents page, check the box associated with the document. 
  2. Select Lifecycle from the Document Actions menu. 
  3. In the Document Lifecycle menu bar expand the Status drop-down menu. The statuses you can select from depend on the current status. Click to select one, then press Next. 
  4. In an Inbox workspace, if the new status has an action associated with it (for example, moving or revising the document), perform the required action. 
  5. If the new status is configured to trigger an activity (message, approval or automatic distribution), the next screen will show the activity that is configured for this status. Either complete this activity, select a different activity from the drop-down menu or close the window.
