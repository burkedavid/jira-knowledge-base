###  Manage Distribution Codes

Note  Available when Automatic Distribution is enabled.

FusionLive allows users to automatically distribute uploaded documents to
nominated recipients via specified print shops or by digital means (see [
Distribution ](../../Documents/New_Topic8.htm#h) ). The rules by which
documents are distributed are determined within a Distribution Matrix (see [
Distribution matrix ](../../User_Settings/Distribution_matrix.htm#h) ).

Automatic distribution of documents allows users to select the distribution
action and reason for issue which relate to the activity and role within that
activity of the recipient. These options are each identified by a unique
letter, configured in the Manage Distribution Codes page.Â

For example, if you want the distribution matrix to send reports digitally for
review, then if Neil is the lead reviewer, Frank a consolidator and Geraldine
a commenter, in the relevant reports row of the distribution matrix you might
enter the following codes against Neil (R/T), Frank (R/S) and Geraldine (R/C),
invoking the distribution action Digital Copy - Formal Review and the
respective reasons for issue of: For control/to distribute, For Comment
Consolidation and For Comment.

Idox suggests the following set of distribution codes for activities initiated
through automatic distribution.

Â  |  Activity  |  Â  |  Role  |  Distribution Action / Reason for Issue

Note  If the workspace contains custom review types, replace the R - Formal
Review code with a code for each formal review type. Use a unique lower case
letter for each. For example, if the formal review has two review types,
âfor reviewâ and âfor approvalâ, then the codes would be: r - Digital
Copy - Formal Review_For Review and a - Digital Copy - Formal Review_For
Approval.

Note  how some codes for reasons for issue are reused. This is because each
reason for issue performs a specific action depending on the activity selected
for distribution action (see the table below).

  1. In the Workspace Settings pane, press Manage Distribution Codes. 
  2. Each distribution action is assigned to a code letter. All distribution codes must be a unique letter plus case, for example, A and a can both be used.Â 

To assign a code to an action, enter a letter in the Code Value box and select
Digital Copy - Approval, Digital Copy - Message, Digital Copy - Formal Review
or a business process from the Action drop-down menu. Then press Add.

  1. To assign a code to a reason for issue, enter a letter in the Code Value box and select the corresponding reason for issue from the Action drop-down menu. Then press Add. 
  2. To edit an existing code, check the appropriate box to select it and press Update. Note Once a distribution matrix has been uploaded to the workspace, the codes cannot be edited. 
  3. To remove a code, check the appropriate box and press Remove.Â
