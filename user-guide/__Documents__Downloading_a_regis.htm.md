The tabs in the spreadsheet represent the document categories used in the
workspace, and each presents the metadata relevant to that category.Â

If the reference is constructed from numbering parts, these are displayed
underneath the purple Reference cell.

Note  Any fields that are set by the system (for example, Actual Review Date),
those that are set as Hide on Upload and those that are inactive will not be
included.

Note  Any fields that are in the number and in the metadata and are normally
automatically populated (for example, Discipline) can be left blank. They will
be automatically populated during bulk import.

  1. To enter the folder you want each placeholder to be created in, select the folder in Fusionive, click on the Copy folder path button at the bottom right of the screen and then paste the link into the Folder field.

Note  If no folder path is provided, the currently selected folder will be
used.

  1. In Deliverables Management categories, if scheduling is required, the submission and issue dates relevant to each reason for issue are added to the right of the category metadata. Only the reasons for issue used in the workspaceâs milestone chains are used (unless there are no milestone chains, in which case all of the reasons for issue in the reason for issue code table are included) and they are presented in the order they are listed in the milestone chains. Make sure that the dates follow the chronological order set out in the schedule. 

If Planned Submission, Forecast Submission, Planned Issue and Forecast Issue
dates are entered as part of a schedule, do not also add them in the
metadata.Â
