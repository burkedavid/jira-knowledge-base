###  Work package document

Once a work package document has been created it is associated with the folder
it was created in and cannot be moved to another folder. Neither can it be
attached as a link to another document. In other respects, however, it can be
treated like a normal document and can be downloaded, checked-out,
distributed, attached to, linked to, used in activities and deleted in the
normal way.

If the contents of the work package folders change, you can repackage them
(see [ Repackage a folder ](Repackage_a_folder.htm#h) ).

The work package document automatically contains links to the documents that
comprise the work package. These static links cannot be deleted but, if a
constituent document of the work package is deleted, the link will also be
deleted and, when the folder is repackaged, the change table will show the
document as removed.

If a constituent document exists as a link in the work package folder to a
document in a different folder, if the link is deleted, when the folder is
repackaged, the change table will show the document as removed. However, the
document it is linked to will remain.

When linked documents have attachments which are not required in the work
package these can be deleted.

Any manual attachments to the work package folder can be deleted.
